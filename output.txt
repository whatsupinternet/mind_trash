THANK YOUUUUUU
i greatly enjoyed it
the crazy asshole dev cancelled the sequel because some people were mean to him on twitter.
what're ya gonna do
cry
cancel games
can you think of a better url
for the blog
not even remotely
ok me neither
i'd resist the impulse to retool anything
and just churn out material while you still have the spark
ok yeah
i did start to do that
i deleted a few things
but i really do think they were bad
i can keep this going for a little while longer
yesyes
let me know if you wanna write something for it
will do yo
i can add you to the contributor thing
that'd be gr9
i love the tone of just
fuck this whole institution
yep
it was a little tough
to write those things about beaker
but i fucking suffer for my art
omg
the overgrown review was just
pitch perfect
ahaha thanks
wrote that with mike
got that hemingway going on
damn that was good
"is james blake the future of dubstep? whats dubstep? why are we still talking about dubstep?? i thought this review is about james blake????? is it???????? (seriusly though, can someone tell me wht dubstep is??)"
i refuse to believe i have peaked
You're only 14
You have your whole life ahead of uou
In which to worry that you peaked just now
seriously considering putting something in the next review like
"what do i know? i'm just a 14 year old witha keyboard"
and in the next one claim to be 22 with a liberal arts degree
nor sure rn
im ready to write a review
corgiexorcism plz 2 make me contributor

what a relief to write something and honestly not give a fuck
feels good
good stuff
james
good stuff
tytyty
ok i just messed with the ending a little bit
look it over
tweak it to fit your style
or if you honestly think it was better before, change it back to that
this one is your call
i just wanted a reason to use the phrase
"manimal collective"
brilliant
publish it
in the futuer i 100% defect to your judgement
don't you dare even dignify this as a proper project with editing or whatever
ahaha
ok
do it
do it immediately
wait change it to 500000
do it
any suggestions
not edits, impulses
wait holy shit
changing "donkeys"
to "donkies"
made it like
twice as good in my mind
do it
how did you get that gif to upload
and there we go
10/10 best new blog post
i tried but you should too
that paints Drake in the same light as Miley Cyrus
I CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THIS
THE ALBUM
HAVEN'T EVEN READ YOURS YET

a former child star who's now famous due to oversexuality
AHAHA

100000/10
tyty

fuck everything am i right
ha ha ha
you are so right
yeah i'll check em out ASAP
please edit tho
haha
death grips
fuck death grips yo
my first experience with them
i've honestly never listened at all
was my total asshole acquaintance
not even friend
asking me to go down to a record store i live neat
*r
and buy him
a fucking
CASSETTE
of "the new death grips album"
fuck no
omfg
lik vinyl i understand
some people hear a quality difference
do you though
does anybody honestly give a shit about vinyl
and like
vinyl has a certain aesthetic
if you dig that, alright
but LIKE
A CASSETTE
really
yeah i don't know
there's no excuse for that
there's no excuse for anything
i need more albums to destroy
i feel like the number of people who act like they give a shit about vinyl but don't
is larger than the number of people who give a shit about vinyl
if any
what will happen to vinyl when it's outdated
(which it already is)
but ALSO stops being cool
cds
review the new "chvurches" album
i haven't listened to it
then mp3s
and i already fucking hate it
wax cylinders
laserdisks
ok
i'm on it
seriously though if you just
look at the cover
and the genre
i can just already tell i'd fucking despise it
fuck music yo
haha it's like shitty purity ring
maybe i should do purity ring
yeah fuck music
good thing there's this blog
to write about music on
and also hate
omg
i added mike as a contributer
contributor
there we go
because the hemingway thing was hoo
who's mike
*goo
d
but he's adding shit
that does not at all fit with the blog
part of me is like
"yes haha that's even better"
but it was just not funny
not even in a not funny way
what stuff tho
just...
fuck
oh he put up like
rick astley
and was like
"haha it's 2008 got you"
and a really shitty long review
wow what a cuntbag
of the broken bells album
who's mike though
that tried too hard
mike suh
he's a pretty alright guy
butlike
not for this
i don't even know you ben
have we met in real life
yeah we did
i'm literally too old for this shit
haha yeah
haha yeah

in 2010
i was probably fucking annoying

i always confuse jonah spawk and literally everybody else his age
no worries dude
i'm still fucking annoying
i still try
yeah
you know jonah spawk right
then i saw you at spash a while back
yeah jonah
he's not on fb any more but
all i remember about him
well two things
he was a major douchebag when  i knew him at cty
one was his incredibly white skin
better now i think
two was that he made fun of me when i had a seizure
he's hella white
and i was not happy about it
yeah
yeah
no worries
he was a major asshole
now i'm 19 and literally don't give a shit
because i'm so old, etc
yes etc.
old and wise, have seen the world, etc
ok back to music

i'll accept it
omfg

that i don't even know wht it's for yet
but i will use later
damn
#rekt
"it isn't though"
haha ok so
tonight's platter
that fucking
drake song
and then sleigh bells
i'm listening to Hold On We're Going Home on repeat to make me angry enough to write
HAHA I HAD A FUCLKING GREAT
clincher
that i was going to use for the drake one but didn't
omg
haha sick

iifh
did  just
watch this
yes
yes
yes
im so angry
good
let it flow thru you
and it begins.
"Single Review: Sam & Drake — Hold On, I'm Coming Home"
so idea right now
is that drake is a fucking idiot
and losing it
and decides to spend the last of his meager fortune
eenacting a black sexist power fantasy
and rents a little cargo thing
and some fake guns
and makes his friends pretend that they're real
because he's a jerk
omg
please
do it
don't think just write
haha fuck i need to work
got nothing done all day
once i finish writing this will be my reward
if i lose the perfect mindset
i'll just watch that garbage again
i made this
there
be back in a few
cya
it's back up to 9998
What is
its never going to reach 10000
Nope
god dammit
"public access television" was really good
but "random access mammaries"
Omg
It's literally beyond over into beginning again
Also I encourage you to rework my drafts to fit them with your style if you like
I have literally zero ego attached to them and won't have anything close to an emotional reaction to my children being fucking vandalized

i did something terrible
huhhurs

by which i mean
fucking terrible job

so yeah nice job

"at this climax of this delusional power fantasy, drake kisses his paid shakira impersonator, knowing that within minutes scores of repo men will arrive to take away everything he owns"

and i couldn't get it out of my head until i made this
Sleestak?? OH GOD

no there is some definite sleestaking going on here
You have a problem

Omggggg nice
haha thanks
i like this oen
*ne
ok so in the draft
the spacing on the title was all fucked up purposefully
like
G  I  R    L
but it doesn't let you do that, multiple spaces get turned into one apparently
so the next best thing was "Album Review: Pharrfetch’d — G R I L L"
LOL
took a break on music
to concoct some throughly shitty tweets
please
join weird twitter
blossom like a beautiful flower
but how
or what
how do i get into this
homestarrunner
let homsar be your spirit animal
fuck
same tho
haha so
i have terrible, terrible news
for you
oh god
oh
god
are you ready
yes
so my dad has a friend from business school
had dinner with him tonight
veryseriousmusi
veryseriousmusi
actually very close
tes
yes
yes
>>>>>>>>>>>>>wa
veryseriousmusi
so he knows
the book
guys
at funny or die
which i never really liked at all
OOOOOOOOOOOHhhh
which is why i'm considering it
so basically we have a direct line to a few producers there
what on earth are you planning
i'm supposed to send him our favorite pieces tonight
a fucking
you are 100% allowed to use my stuff if you like but frankly i think the best pieces are yours
thing
haha, really?
i appreci8
i showed a few to my friends here at school
Nothing Was The Same had this one guy literally crying
Beach House was 10/10
that would be awesome
easy
okay that sounds pretty good?
why is there a question mark
Yes yes yes
but yeah
i'd be totally down with that
i really like a lot of what you've done
I'd be beyond flattered
But you just get the deal first ok xD
haha i'll see what i can do
ok so
one more small thing to add
ok
so those 5 you picked
do you think that they are /the most funny/
as in
having knowledge of the music, or whatever blogs or something we're parodying
could make them /better/
but even without that
they'd still be /good/
beach house works without knowledge of the music
nothing was the same works without knowledge
of course it is a music blog, so our audience should have a pretty good idea of stuff
the drake video explains why it's funny sentence by sentence
haha ok
sky ferarri is entirely unrelated
yes
james blake is the only specific one
yeah
and i think it's mostly about his hair
hmm
yes it is
i think the funniest articles you write are the ones that absolutely don't care about the music at all
they are just total non sequiturs
yep
ahaha
the first one
is the embodiment
of the blog's ideal
to me
imagine dragons?
yeah
this part doesn’t matter and no one will read it
brilliant
even sticking nominally to the part 1 2 3 format
and then his face like 7 times
and filling them in in unrelated ways
cracks me up
yes
haha
i love that you called the pentagons hexagons
people will get so mad about that
i was hoping someone would notice that
also
aha
HA
i think im gonna review movits
aka hot blonde swedish adam savage & crew
omg what are you even talking about
hot blonde swedish adam savage & crew
what the FUCK
it's swedish swing blues hiphop rap jazz
i'm dying over here ok
it's a pretentious blog's wet dream
anyway they were cool in 2010
and i was a cool little fucking freshman
they're so good omg
so i knew about them
yeah it's like
i love banjolele
it's actually fantastic.
they have two pretty good albums
they became REALLY REALLY
REALLY
popular
in sweden
and their music is pop shit now
it's still better than american pop shit
but it's very overproduced
and doesn't have the same spark
it's pop.
but earlier stuff A+
on the note of shitty overproduced pop
Hold On We're Going Home
Hold On We're Going Home
Hold On We're Going Home
shhhhh
wait
is this actually aloe blacckk
this is
yeah not listening to this anymore
also
yeah dude they were on fuckin \
colbert
seriously though is he hot blonde swedish adam savage or what
like the guy from mythbusters
i'd tap that
yeah
right
they're all fucking hipsters tho
swedish hipsters
classic swedes
even worse
literally shit music thread? literally shit music thread

>lead kid actor is anthony michael hall
excuse me what why
so im gonna play that in the background
while just
messing with it
and then send her th video

so i posted something
saying
"someone please buy me some gallium"
because i learned you could buy gallium
and then she fucking
bought me gallium
like actually

ok new challenge
oh god
movits
no
ask where jamie hyneman is the entire time
keep asking over and over
yeah
basically yeah
that is the plan
haha the other one i was gonna do
is
"is anyone really /that hip/?"
fuck music dude
nobody's even that femur
yeah exactly
you can't be that hip
he's too hip
something is very wrong here
we need to fucking get to the bottom of this
also where is jamie hyneman
thats prt of it
thats part of the intrigue
fuck i need to write this
i just mashed up 'blurred lines' with sigur ros
fuck
i never want to hear it ever
(please send it to me)
no sir
that's one for the vault
haha know what i could do
make mashups of old songs
and the modern songs that ripped them off
it would basically sound the same but slightly worse
it would "make a point"
but not at all
fuck that
like, mash up blurred lines
and give it up
i give up
"got to give it up"
it's over
please do it
do it
pelase
the marvin gaye song
nooooope
and blurred lines
it would SOUND THE SAME JAMES
THE SAME
I DON"T WANT TO BE THIS PERSON ANY MORE
ahaha

because it plays on how people want to be cool
and everyone
everyone
wants to be cool
okay so like
there are lots of music sharing services
ahaha
i dont even wanna be rich tho
which will help
anyway it's fucking stupid
you just like
set a song
as your jam for the day
change it whenever
maybe a top 3
but i tihnk i'll just go for 1 at a time
the interface will be pretty
would you name it like
and it'll save your history
yeah sure
why not
that does
vowels left out
exactly
what you're describing
so idiots who use stuff
right now
will like it
ben
you're describing an existing product

FUCK
i thought you were joking like
THEY DID THAT TOIO

wait seriously
yes
h/o i'll attach it
ok i absolutely cannot find it
wait like
with douchebag too
like literally the same thing
sorta
huh.
well that's freaky
i'm only slightly unnerved that you would make that connection
so i have this great idea for an app
but im not a developer
also its already been dne
also you should do all of it
also here use this stupid name
also it should exist because of my bizarre highly personal use case
thanks
there
i found it
disgustingly, already been done
ahaha
wtf
hey i'm making this movie
about facebook
and i love that halfpage design
do you mind if i use that for a poster?
I'll kill u
whatever the people who made that music website are gonna fail
who would even think of that idea
idiots
it's not monetizeable
lol
how do i relocate a kneecap
google it
james
my fucking kneecap is dislocated
well
don't ask me
i'm not a doctor
you just play one on tv
i should've know
n

ahaha
in short, don't be a little bitch, go shout 'is there a doctor in the house'
it is BOTH kneecaps

the right one is way worse than the left
but they are both fucked up

i hope you know about this
james
ben zweig

you dislocated both kneecaps and spent a half hour on fbmessage with me

remember when
drake shot all those guys in miami
that was crazy
Hey Ben, seeing this photo makes me a little sad and I don't want others to see it. Would you please take it down?
i'll see you in court
Hi James, I know you wanted the post I made taken down, but it's important to me that I keep it posted.
i'll fucking murder you
i can't figure out how to do this
i accidentally reported this chat session as "suspicious" looking for the options to send this bullshit
oh well
susPICIOUS CHAT SESH
yeah
faceboko is going to review you
for being
you're like the 20th person to report me tho
"fraudulent and suspicious'
i mean this was accidental
were the rest
'punk'
'genius'
'traitor'
'douchebag'
i totally interacted with you
MULTIPLE times
LOL
MULTIPLE LONG TALKS
AT LEAST TWO PROPER NOUNS
YEAH
and you fucking
omg you have to forgive me
forget about me
it's literally impossible to tell apart all the white people i know
what did they say at the end of the breakfast club, james
'no free napkins
what did they fCUKING SAY
'you might have to stop and enjoy life once in a while or it might pass you by'
yes
if you were one of the kids in the breakfast club
the library would have burned down
the nerd would have shot himself
we could've had a fight club though
the jock and the girl would hate each other
and the crazy one would subsist only on her own fingernails
i mean
you say this stuff like it's a bad thing
wait you mean this stuff didnt actually happen in the movie?
what did i watch then
oh no

fffffbbg
bbfgfbfbh
hey james
you do
computer Science
write an app
to let us do this fucking shit
to people
more easily
oh NO
like, it just grabs a bunch of posts
from 2008 or 9
or maybe set the year
and presents them in a very simple interface
there's probably rules against autoliking
for liking them
oh god
considered spam or something
so you just
oh god
maybe coordinate with others
tinder but for 2008 facebook posts
oh god YES
for maximum news feed relevence
yEAH
i actually would like to make that
how are the facebook APIs
i don't know
james what languages do you know
naavi doesn't fucking count
so don't even fucking say it
uh
spurnglish
programming
spanglish
spunglung
fuck
springlish
python c java fortran
javascript html css
we could do it
or
i could like it all myself
i honestly would like to do it
i could do interface stuff
the world needs this
dude you could prbly do it urself
do you have any programming experience?
i work much better with people
get bored way too easily alone
yeah, javascript
obj
c
python
wtc
*etc
i'm not too fantastic in any of them
but i could probably figure out a way to do this
yeah you could!!!
i'll try to look into facebook APIs
ideally this would be a HTML5, js thing
(i am guessing)
actually
wowowow
do i
destroy us all
nah i need to do this with someone
james
im not even going to school
i am so socially starved it's pathetic

Also do you hate San Francisco y/n
Is south parks fart analogy accurate?
yes and no
what's the fart analogy
YouTube "South Park San Francisco fart"
Do it now and with reckless abandon
well
there was no context
just some douchebags
smelling farts
what does that have to do with sf
other than that those are partly the people who live there
that snake video is just looming over me
especially the way he says "good job"
oh
no
and the noise the snake makes
when it hits the floor
i had to delete it to put it on graeme's wall
so he would be forced to watch it
oh ok
swapped it for another
ok i was wrong
you deserve something better
gotta delete the boat
gotta delete the boat
here you go
this is more to your standards
old
the lion
old
but good
ill take it
Ok mashup idea
"the wonderful thing about tigger" X a whole bunch of samples of Kanye West saying the n word
and next these
TIGGERS
might snatch your necklace and then these
TIGGERS
might jack ya lexus somebody tell these
TIGGERS

no permissions or something
uh
one sec

ok
i'll answer them all
great thanks
nailed it
fuck yeah you did
haha so
i know who one of them was
because i have shared my plans
oh lawd
plz
america's premier sports walrus
america's premier sports walrus?
YES
caps
yes
??!?!?!
yeah so
the idea wouldbe
to just
act like it's a thing
and never specify what exactly the purpose is
or what business idea is
holy shit
yes
or how profit margins are SO INCREDIBLY HIGH , JAMES
have you seen the cash this venture is raking in
basically the idea is the crowdfunding joke
ie
never explainuing what crowdfunding is
omfg
yes
but hyping the shit out of it
but instead of crowdfunding
"america's premier sports walrus"
omg
i'll do it
just tell me exactly what to do
good
im making the twitter avatar right now
hold on
we're
going
home
why is it so fucking hard
to get a good picture of a backwards baseball cap
to put on something
namely a walrus
lol
so
the main point of this entire endeavor
is that even i don't really understand it
or its aim
there's a group of guys laughing outside the door of my room
they talk quietly for thirty seconds and then erupt into brief, braying laughter
i want to kill them all
hahaha
progress so far
it's already disgusting
don't stop
i think it's done
any suggestions
give him a pebble watch
oh my god
give him a pebble watch and a north face jacket
how the fuck will i do tht
even the watch will be like
lol idk
fucking stupid
haha
how do i do this
they don't make walrus jackets
loooooool
wow
i might need to think of this
*on
wowe
im considering
"fuck"
or maybe
"invest in me"
'original gangster'
i want this to be vaguely financial
'i live for this twitter shit'
ideally he will be the ringleader
of a large twitter cultural movement
#sueypark
but it should seem like there is one
hahahHAHAHa
looks like someone
beat me to it
wow
make your first tweet a #cancelcolbert reference
do it or else

i just made it
#chopsueypark
#downswithavene
its uploading
hold on
we're

not as good as 'f1rst post'
but it'll do, pig

In Nordic folklore, the Stommefader, or “Skeleton Dad,” is said to run through the woods on Father’s Day, crying that the devil has swallowed his son. Norwegian men act out the story by running through the town streets at midnight shouting the same.
Families in Ukraine hide a tiny Father’s Day Skeleton in a bowl of borscht. If the father chokes on the skeleton, the child who chooses to save his father receives 15 hryven.

takes a cup
fills it with only soy creamer 2/3 of the way
and i'm like
assuming she's gonna add coffee
and i think "damn that's a lot of creamer, plus creamer is gross anyways"
but then
she doesn't add coffee
she takes the cup
and passes it to her ~4 y/o child
who begins to drink it
that's
disgusting

this is the problem
the black man though
the b l a c k  m a n
he's just like
"I'm tired of this shit"
is this news because the culprit wasn't black
or because the little girl was being coached to say her lines
i... think so.
was this florida
either.
probably.
yes.
fuck news
yep
fuck
news
en.wikipedia.org
/wiki/
there are lots of nonfictional bears
lots
can i rant @ you for a sec
mhm
im so fucking fed up w/ online courses
the lack of basic QA is disgusting
if they were free i would care less
but this shit's like
what's QA
money
quality assurance
aka
???
making sure that the assignment i just downloaded
doesn't start with "question 2"
instead of question one
i mean what are you expecting here
oh
i see
implying that some question has been delted
do i need to worry about it
or do i just do it
i don't know because i called them and they didn't pick up
i don't care about old US history anyway
modern stuff maybe
because it will give me context for things happening now
and then i can talk as if i know what I'm talking about
i still wont
but i can talk like it
ahahaha
well ben
things are no different at college
or in the real world
running a college course is a messy business and the professors frequently don't have the time for organization
all that matters is that you learn the material
i'm at a big uni paying buttloads and my profs are unorganized
and that's ok
yeah.
it's aight tho
online courses suck
i know because half my classes this semester had their hw online
where you'd type 4.2583 and it'd be like NAH IT WAS 4.2584
and you'd lose full points
yep
WHAT A REF
!?!?!!?!?!
the last one
star trek
aw jeez
wait
i just realized
from your point of view in the chat
you wouldn't see how great this was
fuck
that's so good
isnt it
also
yep
that... actually worked?
i mean
takyon + anything
ok
we need to write some music this week
OK
i'm diggity down

brianzeno? yeah

pun
i was like
"is there really someone named Brian Zeno"
it's a brian eno pun
hey
can you help me prod a backing track
yessir
what u want
lemme do some writing firs
okkk
i'll be around
neat!
thanks
haha
im not sure that i can write raps
i can write
in general
i can probably do spoken word
just write a poem
>>>same thing
exactamundo
and then you can figure how to rap it l8r
thats the plan
gonna say some shit bout my generation or something
not like howl tho (fuck howl)
LOL
i love howl
it gave us the best tmbg song
haha
i know a lot of douchebags who love it
so i dont
classic
rebellion is as mindless as conformity, ben
i read that in a book
OR DID I
YOU DID RIGHT
but yeah man
I'm trying to write spoken poetry
well
i have a backing track
oh?
i was just gonna use leisureforce instrumental
until i found something good
or made something good
lemme hear it
is it space music
idk
prob not
k
But that's none of my business
fuck
are you on an air plane
at least you're not
over the sea
oh man
we never made a music blog post
about the sleigh bells guy
and his "true shred life"
shit
omh
she made one where im a muppet

>implying you're not anyway
>i can't see the difference
i know
i know
whatre ya gonna do i guess
i mean if we're being real gere
my teen idol
same
hey
quick css question
yo
i want to set the "#bottom" div
(which is the portrait of me)
it should be centered
so that is is cropped from the center
rather than from the right
u feel
hmm
that's tricky
you could straight up do it with jquery and a function to measure window width
or you could look into html cover attributes
that's all i got
yeah
eh
ill just let it be
OH MAN
ONE TICKET LEFT
FOR THE YO HACKATHON
DO I DO IT
I REGISTERED
hahaha
so
the version i sent you
was the second one
the first version
was styled entirely inline
hey James
I'm talking to the developer of yo
anything I can pass along for you
Tell him that when you log out of the app it's impossible to log back in
is it actually
Yep
wow
I think that's a feature
ok
i think i figured it out
now i just gotta make a nice bio
fuck
how do i jquery
fuck jquery
idk
im so angry at it
you should try
(j)querying
the internet
i think you meant
$(j)querying
i think you meant
smfh
oh, better question
that will be easier
with css, is there a way to make it so that when i hover over an image
some other, different text
will change color?
or would i have to JS
well
do you know about css hover attributes
im learning now, yeah
righto so
you have div{color:red;}
like, if your div had id='foo'
you could type #foo{color:red;
but then you could type #foo:hover{colo
that's all
but there's no way to have hovering a different element
affect a separate element
nah
ok
ok
here's the site now
i'm going 2 bed
it's 1:30
show me tmrw plz
k
nighty night
night
a mashup of
watch?v=bz_Eqawk
smarturl.it/GetHerBack
like, take the two videos
and use the slapping from the first
as the tempo to the other
so it's this video of robin thicke drowning
intercut with young, attractive LA kids slapping each other
it'll be perf
haha
that would be pretty good
just got hurt on a trampoline
i've never been more proud
ben i think i got kicked out of cool freaks
what for
who cares
its played out anyway
mashup of Feel Good Inc — Gorillaz / Feel Good — Robin Thicke
in dentist chair
listening to "just hold on I'm going home" for duration of filling
on loop
because a greater pain
will distract me from the lesser
of a spinning piece of metal
hollowing out my bone
Just hold on, we're drilling bone
fuck you
I laughed and it hurt
It's hard to brush these teeth alone
I got some plaque on you
It's everything that I ate
I want your toothpaste and some flossing endlessly
the DOG delusion
LOL
those videos are actually brilliant
oh man I was a little weird on pain mess
mess
*meds
and made like
6 more
they're lucid and really funny
I'll forward them to you
send them all to me
will send rest
dinner brb
LOL
L O L
i think thats all of them
ben
the robin thicke story gets better
then it got sad
>>>>>
yeah, story of the world right there
honest tho Robin Thicke
best new artist
i'm lovin this saga
he made the kids
do it for him
"I know"
because he couldn't do it himself
"I'll make this video with kids"
"everyone loves kids"
"she definitely loves kids"
"she'll watch URL
*it"
"and take me back"
is how many of the kid couples are interracial
"now get out there you fucking kids
all of them
actually
robin thicke and hitler
wouldn't get along
so he's got that going for him
I guess
LOL
abrupt exclamation
HO
what a shitty song
i love robin thicke
it's hilarious
me and my friends
have a club
where we reenact the robin thicke text messages with each other
I made a whole album about you
omg
omg
haha i'm trying to remember his lyrics
from that other song
"all i wanna do"
"is play you that song"
"give you that thing"
give you that thing
"go to that place"
play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
or something
oh haha
it's funnier when they're all super general
that thign
>his dick
#ROBIN THICKE HAS A BIG DICK
#robin thick has a big d
ivorce ahead of him
hoHOOOO

and buy a used one
i ain't got $600
here's a push for $416 on ebay
i think i'm gonna get one
so what you're saying is
i can make the ableton pad function as a multi track looper

holy fuck
i'm gonna buy this
hey wait
one thing
before you do
Yeah
two things
i just took a test
that i delayed a day to study for
i didnt really study either of the days
i just dicked around
i did fuck nothing
my mother just asked if the studying helped
i admitted that i had not studied at all over two days
said i remembered it enough anyway, which is true
and then ran out of the room screaming "i've learned nothing from this experience"
oh other thing
look up how push registers
there's some BS drm
that's bad news
you mean
holy moley
so for $600 i can get a legal copy of Ableton Live 9 Intro (more than enough) with the controller
that's doable
haha

that sounds do fake
*so

that isnt real
but yeah
what do you think
good plan?

and yeah
live is hella dope
infinitely variable
$600 for 2 legit 2 quit

im down
also
yes
jamie xx just put out
a new track
i have heard 2 min of it
i bet pitchfork fucking loves it
i dunno who that is
one sec
yo i just got a new fav artist that pitchfork hates
that's why i like him
Har Mar Superstar
YEP
BEST NEW MUSIC
don't care
it's good
why would they dislike it
0:43
that foot spin
0:41 sry
oh nice
just saw it
do you know the heavy?
yep
ahh ok
see them live if you can
he's the coolest dude
ben i have a confession 2 make
you went to dashcon this year
didnt you
i don't like seeing bands live
i like live music if it's classical or jazz or opera
aw really?
but for 'modern' music
i don't really care for it
hm, okay
i dont know if i like it either
or if i just tell myself i like it
i cant afford it most of the time anyway, so it doesn't really matter
LOL
i dunno if it's that
i just grow an attachment to the original production
and if it's exactly the same in concert, it's like 'why am i here'
and if it's different, it feels weird
ahh, okay
i dont get that feeling
but i can understand it
with some acts, the energy of being there is worth it
it's not for the musical talent
shit like justice
that was incredible
hurk
hurkrk
10/10
ok, new jamie xx track
really like the mid synth
the one above the bass
wanna figure out how to do it
sounds really warm
wait
james
yessir
next year
we're going to make a kickstarter
oh no
to get us to dashcon 2015
so we can laugh at people
that's our description
in the backer rewards
that's not even a bad idea
as in
we'll laugh at a specific group of people you specify
or
if you make that kickstarter and post it on reddit at just the right time
we'll say your name out loud
i think we could legitimately do that
while laughing at people
yeah, i think we actually could.
i'm only 25% kidding.
we'll raise $170
$170.00
$170.00
my other idea
was a kickstarter
to raise 17k
to napalm bomb dashcon 2015
i'm down
91653886940/
superwholockhunt

hunting superwholocks

noted
because i'm right
luckily it really doesnt matter what my mother thinks of you
also, it's right
haha so
in cool freaks wiki club
the admins are power tripping
don't tell me
and it's hilarious
the heartbreak is too much
can you reinvite me lol
they're such assholes
did they ban you
yeah
for literally nothing
eeeyup
and called them on their bullshit
and the fucks banned him
and then that asshat "becci lim"
bragged about it
haha fuck this group
ahahaha
only thing to do, make a group called "cool farts' wikipedia fuck"
make sure it gets at least a little popular
make sure sleepie brdie is mad and in the group
when she says "this is a ripoff of our group, shut it down"
she's the admin and founder
LOL
or die
ugh i wanna make it tho
and either have it be an actual alternative without asshole mods
or a parody of the mods
one of the two
cant decide which
also need to pick a really fantastic name
cool christian's conservapedia club
actualy that's an amazing idea for a club
haha
too late
requiem for a dream 2
back in the saddle
ugh
i sorta really do want to make an alternative group without the assholes
and then just not moderate it at all
LOL
can we do that
actually can we make one
only for no context wiki images
in the same style
that we moderate loccrla
i would like that a lot
HAHA WAIT
i just found my fav instance
of shutting down an unfunny
hit me
this fucking girl alex santina
kept trying to make jokes
so then she was like
"you sound like my physics teacher"
and then i said "you cant fucking joke about this" or something
and then she said
"my bad physics grade is no joke"
i later learned that this might have legitimately made her cry
also, i just threw up in my mouth

'higher than thou'
accuses someone of being on a high horse
>misusing the term 'holier than thou'
calls me a "good kid"
>calling someone ignorant in the same breath
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>
it got worse
don't send her anything
it's not worth it
oh ben
you have so much to learn
it's always worth it
you'll get more of a kick out of this
post it all in the group
post all of it in the group
can i at least tell her it's 'holier than thou'
LOL
holy fuck
did she just call me attractive
should i start a conversation with her about how i was sexually assaulted in high school
dyou think that'd help
or dyou think i should tell her about my grandfather's ptsd from WWII
this is honestly the greatest thing that's happened to me on facebook in, like
years
i know james
i know
i was really nice to her this whole conversation
can i at least tell her it's 'holier than thou'
even though she be talkin down something fierce
ben am i a bad influence on you
almost definitely
w my attractive persona
ok, know what
here you go
wanna tell her that graeme and fomon also h8 sjw
you can say something
but no exact wording
unless it's really subtle
tell her it's 'holier than thou' at least
i feel like she has to know
you can say something as if i talked to you about what she felt without explicitly quoting her
more importantly
do i even know her
like,
yes you may throw in
have we ever met in real life
a holier than thou
i don't dig it
i love that she throws it out there
im published
YEAH
RIGHT?
i loved that
ok wait i found it
the worst part
'making fun of people who try and explain the way society operates
end quote'
HAHA
my response was like
"maybe don't do that on facebook"
after she got really riled up
i said "yeah james is kinda an asshole tbh" to encourage her
LOL
YESSSS
and then she sent the really long one
so
tybg
haha so like
tell her i'm neither straight nor cis and see what she says
in my life
seeing as how
you and becca
are so far above me
LOL
it's time for a photoshop
and becca is an annoying as fuck angel
who is "published"
and you're basically ambien walrus
that's my favorite analogy
come with me on an adventure you'll never remember
kill your parents
>>>
call all your ex girlfriends
oh man i actually did
cut off all your hair let's do this
i was fucked up because i hadn't taken my adhd meds in a while
so when i take them
i get into that bizarre, overemotional "everything is too much" state
and then you watch the expendables
more importantly what am i gonna do about becca tiech
part of that is feeling overly bad about my actions
and then wanting to reconnect with people
and reach out
to people
people
that normally
oh no
oh n o
i would never fuckimg do such a thing towards
so i like
texted my ex girlfriend that i broke up with and don't really like
and put myself in a pretty weird position
becca tiech
what are we gonna do
i'd love to sit down and have a real talk with her about it actually
why don't you want to talk about MY problems
haha do it
have a "real conversation" with her
what are you gonna do about becca though
i dunno
i guess what annoys me the most about trigger culture as she calls it
is that it diminishes the actual triggers and actual ptsd of people with actual trauma in their lives
like emoticon
yep
i have a close friend back home who has real ptsd from abusive parents, street fights, etc
and it boils my blood to see tweens posting about their triggers that make them upset and sad
when for her, a trigger induces a psychotic, violent episode
you know, actual things
yeah
but ok, never mind all of that
not feeling like a slightly wilted flower
because i just solved the triggering problem once and for all
are you ready for this
we build a chrome extension
everybody who wants it installs it
it's a wiki database for all webpages
if someone sees something triggering, they tag it on the sidebar
if your personal filters block that, it'll warn you before loading the page
that way, people who don't care don't see TWs and don't have information blocked
i have a good one too
and people who do care can rely on a tireless social justice brigade to tag everything properly
that's the perfect fix
huh
yeah
that would be pretty ok
ok
now that we've solved that
back to work
whoops
actually not a bad idea though
the music blog has 60 followed
followers
and we haven't posted on it in a long te
one
fuck
time
so that's good
>>>>
i was pretty funny two years ago sometimes
hey james
should i tell her that you're not cis or hey
*het
nd see
what she says
do it
urp
uh oh
shit's hitting the fan in 3 2
1
let's go
she's "seen" it
baDAbaDAbaDAbad
oh
something incredible happened
what
so he wanted me to reply to becca
and say "screenshotted & sent 2 james"
and i said no
screenshot them
send them to you
you reply "HAHA I LOVE IT"
i screenshot THAT
And then that's what i send to her
LOL
i'm on board
haha
29540405_124314
2826706721805_n
and then goes on a radio show
with james blake
where he plays james blake's new song
which is weird as fuck
and not very good
no way this is a coincidence
this has to be tied into hamas
i like  cool losers' wikipedia group because it allows me to separate the assholes from the sjw in my life
basically everyone is either one or the other
THATS A FALSE DICHOTOMY
STRAW MAN
BEGGING THE QUESTION
HOLIER THAN THOU
higher*
so
what are we gonna do about becca
idk
how do you solve a problem like becca
hey james
did you see the content i posted
please post some content
we need
content
if anything we need less content
and less consumers
and less malaysian airplanes
CHECK
shot down a civ plane
or boiiii
oohhh\
boiii
26 us peeps
were on it
oh boy
so
apparently
even though it was at a totally different elevation
so they shot it down and bragged about it
on TWITTER
and now they are deleting tweets
classic twitter
also, israel is invading gaza

Ben you have to
It's worth anything

NO
That defeats the purpose
oh god
you are gonna make me lose some friends
Wow I am not using these right today
I'm ok with that I guess
Isn't it?
Ask if there are any sentences in the English language that couldn't be potentially triggering to someone
help me understand the last message
"like i dont think its legitimate to use in any form, like youre a funny kid whose smart and witty and stuff and others are too with way more content in ya repitiore"
translate
You can do better humor than making fun of tws
OH BOI

This is amazing

if i was like
"haha your vid is super funny, can you send me the script haha"
or we could each do 3
LOL
ben i'm gonna make you lose all yr friends

he's the one what got me out of my shell when i was like, 12

FUCK

Conrad Stonebanks
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>y

Conrad Stonebanks
ive been really depressed before
this isnt that
this is like
basically being a lazy fuck
24/7
LOL
that's just being lazy
and only way out is to yell at yourself
nah its nor normal person lazy
until you're not lazy any more
this is like
wake up at 12
eat nothing
do nothing
lazy
i have no advice for you other than to rediscover your love for the world
...through expendables 3
whenever i got like that back in high school
i would go on long walks through the heart of the city
i'd walk around until it struck me suddenly that they excavated 100 feet down in a trench running miles under the city, like, 70 years ago
and i'd just think about that and how they did it
and how they put the bedrock from under grand central and the marble and built city college with it
and it'd get me motivated to study again
woah
you just gotta find what drives you, et
etc
"transporter" isnt streaming
Leon the professional is
And it's a brilliant movie
nope it isnt
fuck
Just google "Leon the professional watch online free" c'mon, Ben
"expendables 3 leak"
"expendables 3 download leak"

guess
mozilla
yahoo
netscape
friendster
geocities
myspace
opera
well

and stupid as fuck
yahoo
so yahoo
was a viable answer
NICE
hahaha

nope
yO
YO
YO
YO
NO
NO
YO
NO
YO
IT CAN'T BE
YO
YO
YOU DIDN'T
YO
holy fuck are you serious
pics or it didn't happen
not even kidding
P I C S
and yeah it's a schmuck with 2.6 mil
oh it was a spoken discussion last night
i'm tucked though
i've gotten bad
at objective c
you met the shmuck
i can make pretty mockups
jfc
this can't be real
but i need to get way better at objective C in a week
and learn pop
which doesn't seem too bad
pop?
facebook's animation framework
they used it when creating
P A P E R
oh jeez
you're ascending
dude, any chance to be closer to that app's ideal form
i take
i want to be paper
i want to live paper
paper
jfc ben
i'm proud
but you better ask for equity
hahahah no
i have no fucking references
i'm doing a trial week
at 25 an hour
and if they like me, it'll get better
or ill leave
and be like
"holy shit, i got fired by 'yo'"
"does that even count"
"can they do that"
and then i'll dismiss the entire thing as an extended dream sequence
which would explain why i went to a park at 11:30 PM and went on swings with the guy who gave me the offer
i don't even believe this
he isnt the douchebag in chief
this is entirely too much
he's a cool kiddo
but like
james
here's the thing
i have good ideas
and because of my good ideas, he gave me the offer
and then he was like
"you can implement these ideas, right?"
and i was like
"UH"
"GIVE ME A WEEK"
"TO REFRESH MYSELF"
LOL
aka fucking relearn everything
jesus christ
so i'm probably fucked
whatever
it'll be an adventure
james i have 0 experience and i dont know what i'm doing
all the suggestions i gave him for the app were just based on what i felt
maybe i can be aN INSTINCTUAL DESIGNER
haha yeah
haha i'm gonna start "#STATIC"
haha james
james
the review of the fucking boar app
has 2200 views
2350
BOAR 2014
#2014
so yeah
i know notjing
and am expected to know things
he was like "so have you done any contract work recently"
and i was like
"can you implement your changes in under a week?"
implementation is overrated
new cover photo for u
when you get the jorb
not even kidding will do
i'm not sure i'll accept it
do it now
i'm just not qualified
ben
like, i have good ideas that they like
it's $25/hr and you're in high school
but they might as well steal them and hire a good ios dev to do it
dude
these fucking kids
are 17
and doing contract work
this isn't fuckingnorma
there's nothing to kick your ass into gear like a job
haha i'm not though
people like me
and i look like i know what i'm doing
even sound like it 75% of the time
LOL
fuck okay
i know you're right
you're perfect
take the job
fuck okay
if you can't do it, quit with money and a story
i need to learn objective c
*re
learn
in a week
fuck
yeah  but what else were you really gonna do this week tbh
other than make mashupos
yeah tbh
that or go to new york
instead i'll be at home
on adderall
reading apple documentation
actually might do nyc anyway
smile emoticon
haha james
i keep having good ideas
and then someone else does all the work
and then we share the credit
but now, i have to also do the work
what a world
frown emoticon
frown emoticon
haha, like
that tweak that is getting good coverage
that was me being like, path had a chat feature
and then line stole it
and then facebook stole it
and now i'm going to steal it
and do it in this way
and my friend who does JB development did all the work
and i made UX choices i guess
like, i designed the functionality. so that's /something/?
not really though
LOL
this is why i work alone
haha yeah
i mean, there is value in good ideas
but only if executed well
and this guy is doing that
so uh
cool
smile emoticon
link me 2 your portfolio agian?
HAHA
my fucking
portfolio
i actually have to rebuild it rn
like, today
because it got fucked up
this is old
"satire"
brb
editing to remove mike's name
and make this entire site less awful/delete it entirely
LOL
oh god
bad move, me
baaad move
i got another job interview
that i am entirely not qualified for
in an entirely different sector
oh man
you know city lights bookstore?
nope
i'm not from san francisco
fuck james
it's catchy
fuck
fuck
oh fuck
"... specializes in world literature, the arts, and progressive politics."
come get it bae
yeah it's a beat poet bookstore
if i work there i'll be mad pretentious and get indie cred
give people dirty looks from behind the counter etc
do it
holy shit
do both jobs
yeah, i'm actually considering it.
i wanna be more varied than most tech kids
it can really swallow your whole world
somtimes i forget that there are like, other things
to do
i'm a mechanical engineer
tell me about it
that's partly because of where i live
and all that
but yeah
i wanna try to avoid that
(i'm switching to phone but still listening)
and working each job half time would do it, i think
it's like, lawrence ferlinghetti
the guy who got me the interview is a brilliant fucker
he's a book editor, top 3 in the world or some shit
and for some reason, he's decided i'm worthwhile
(nice of him, rite?)
when i was a kid, i read like fucking crazy
it's probably why i'm "intelligent"
then i stopped because i'm a tool
so he still thinks i read
and i want to
but i dont
and he always asks "so what're you reading"
so he talked to the dude who runs the place
and was like "there's this kid, he's fucking brilliant, and he reads evertything, these are his SAT scores, and he's flunking high school"
one of those things is true
i am shit at high school
so in both jobs
i seem like a person who would be good
but know almost nothing
so i'm just gonna throw myself into both
and like, see what happens
maybe i'll pick it up along the way
i might drop out, actually
like, entirely
take the ged thing
and have two jobs
haha miley cyrus is in that video
she looks like a salty horse
>i take the job
>walk in, first day
>staff turns to look at me
>slowly turn to face them
>shiteatinggrin
"YO"
>exclaim
>"YO!"
>fired
U irl for real
:')
i think i'll take both.
i just need to decide if i want to finish high school
Why finish high school when you can get 100% on code academy
>>>>
>college
im gonna walk up to the yo engineers

about the vulns?
aight
they're only on jailbroken extensions

and ups them to a server
release it peer to peer as a "beta quick reply tweak" so that it isnt reviewed by a repo admin
and then... i dont know
what the fuck do you do with a bunch of stolen yo accounts
delete them?
let them sit there?
have them send messages back and forth to each other?
????

According to all known laws of ECONOMICS, there is no way a STARTUP should be able to get off the ground. Its FUNDING is too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The STARTUP, of course, flies anyway, because STARTUPS don't care what CONSUMERS think is impossible.

well
buddy
i got bad news for ya
I have a new life plan
does it involve Yo! ?
fuck up my relationships with any and all individuals who are at all influential in the tech world
and then fucking walking away from it to one of hundreds of other careers
yeah I just fucked up an interview
fuck
tongue emoticon
nah man it's bad
I feel physically sick from this bullshit
I never want to see a smartphone again
never heard of them
it's a really nice calendar
oh wait
i know sunrise
I fucked it up in a crazy stupid way
i have it installed right now
and i use it every day
how'd you fuck it up
yup
well
well
I was hyper focused on actually doing the interview challenge
and the guy was chatting me
and asking me if I was actually part of the group where I had seen his hiring post
(I'm not)
and you said
'dyou mean big fart dog?'
and you said
'dyou mean big fart dog?'
and invited him
and I spaced out enough that he became suspicious and it looked like I was intentionally concealing that I'm a high school nothing
I wish
fuuuck

fuck cs anyway

so it's up to me to destroy my opportunities
or you could just go into engineering like the pros

that's me all day
that's me all day
I think you're the first person who has ever made me feel better/realize that I'm being an idiot through a friendly mocking
thanks

alright I still feel like shit

keep working on my shitty interview UI concept
when i feel like shit i like to watch an episode of QI and rediscover my joy for life
yeah alright
I could feel that
do you know QI?
yeah, fun show
that's a good idea
sounds like you got ~mind issues~
I'm making my own
~~~
people weren't depressed before the last 200 years or so
they were either rich children of monarchs and aristocrats, in which case they were all high all the time
or they were farmers, in which case they didn't have time to sit around and think about how sad they were
yeah
that's a real thing
but I don't know how much of that this is right now
it might be more of other anxieties transferred to this one event / a genetic predisposition for hating on myself
I'm gonna go lie down and try to be less inanely psychosomatic
smile emoticon
i've been listening to QI as though it's a radio show during work
i should watch more qi
/listen to
wow
I'm really letting this get to me

what's the etym of "casualties"
huh ok i looked it uo
still don't 100% get it
from those filthy fucking casual gamers
this is going to make someone cry
casualties (deaths) is from the same root as causality (chance)
yeah, not sure where "casual" came from, then
and therefore informal?
okay, i guess i could see tht
index.php?term=c
it's 20s slang, it looks like
hm, okay
gotcha
it's semantic shift

went from unreliable/

here's this stupid website i made
and when i mouse out, it goes back down
to that end, i have separate images of the circle and the glyph for each of the buttons
i'll fix those up later
for now, i just need to understand how to use scale
so
what i don't get is the .toggle
there's mouseover and mouseleave
or .show
and mousein and mouseout
make sure you don't fuck them up
hmm ok
how are they different

TRENDNG HASHTAGS
WHAT THE FUCK
????screenshot for me, I uninstalled
i don't have it installed
the CEO made a
MDEIUM post
i want the NSA to hire me as a contractor
i'll pitch things like
"every man in the world is unique. how? not his fingerprint, or his iris, but his pee stream"
"every man in the world has their own unique pee stream"
"and with my technology, we can use it to track them"
the first good journalism
i did it
did
?
projects
i like the bouncing
thanks
how's the project UI?
it's acting like a mobile ui
which is very disorienting
howso
etc
oh, like
too narrow
i could make it doublecolumn
i dunno what the solution
is
i like how it looks
why not wrap the entire website in a css iphone
marvelapp.github
.io/
and then the narrowness makes sense
i
cant tell if youre kidding
not at all
i think it'd be cool
hmm, okay
hey so
im using a css class to resize right now
and adding and removing it
but that sucks
how can i scale something with jquery
i looked up scale
but it's really unclear
so
the number one tip for aspiring programmers
is to not reinvent the wheel
visionmedia.gith
use a lightweight library that some other poor sap spent hours making as fast and efficient as possible
how do i use that
do i download it?
and then link
it
i've never used a jq lib before
oh this is just js
it's a javascript library
you download it
and link it
and then you can use its methods
ok
ben this may seem like a silly question
but do you have a programming background?
i'm always curious about people who brand themselves as ui/ux people
does that mean you're a designer and know what you like, and it's someone else's job to build it
or are you responsible for full stack webdev, and building the environments you design
bit of both
ive never stuck with programming long enough to be a wizard at it
i have a good idea of what goes into building stuff i draw
unlike some fucking people
i learn pretty quick
i got this page working decently
i can handle some blurry ions
*icons
i do have one really stupid question
yessir
so i have an if statement
that separates mobile browsers
and not mobile browsers
i know how to bind things to handlers
but what do i bind something to
if i just want to happen
as the page loads
no trigger other than the page loading
i can run that within itself?
well
if you're already running it
i am.
you've already solved the problem
huh
ok
so i can just do, say
if you want foo() to occur on page load
$('#picture').a
ddClass('displa
just have foo() as one of the first things in that document onload block
oh yup
turns out a typo caused me to fundamentally understand this language
>
?
haha it's good
it makes sense
like emoticon
if i use find, and there's more than one matching thing in the div
will it select both
or should i use each
lets find out
sweet
find all <br?
*<br>
and replace with spaces
so here's the point for jquery
at some point, you're going to have to start putting content decisions in your html, design in your css, and dynamic attributes in your javascript
holy shit it worked
you're 100% right
instead of having twelve blocks in your code that paint colors
have twelve lines of list items, each with a value
and then a single block of javascript that describes the behavior of a defined class upon hover
but as it is, you're making stone soup
capiche?
go fix your website
im code hitler
this is shit
how did this happen
ben
why not just use
css
ben this is what css is for
this is worse than inline css
there's not even a name for how bad this is
this is literally
the worst
wow
i don't use css anymore james
i just use jquery
to do my css for me
it's time to like
learn how to program
i mean, that's one possible option
i can't figure out what's casuing a tiny gap
fucj
use chrome developer tools
and inspect element
and look at the colorful padding diagram on the right hand panel
yeah found it
the most legitimate piece of music i've ever made
is a joke song
wow
mpaign=default&
utm_medium=Shar
eTools&utm_sour
the last one
holy shit

eTools&utm_sour

i might change the group name
To

"we showed people what they would look like in blackface"
also in that vid
theyre strumming guitars
but theres no guitar noise
whoops
i want to delete my internet
i literally just unfriended mike suh because i'm so sick of his modelling photos on my newsfeed
smile emoticon
:))
I unfollowed him foralways ago
see, like
the thing is
he's not that attractive

and we put up with it
because they're nice to look at
haha james

i'm not sure i even believe it
we're gonna find out
the box is real
they showed it to me
jared wants to know
why muppets is a thing for us
It's sincerity atones for our insincerity
yep
yeah
he's a cool thoughtful dude
hey james
i don't know if i really like programming
i don't know anything
about myself
You know that you like the muppets
that's true, actually
yeah
i like that also
And making animations
For uiux purposes
a lady came on the train with her daughter
and said that she had been battered and they were homeless
and asked for money so they could stay somewhere
a dude next to me gave her a 20
i wanted to tell him that that was a really good thing of him to do
but i didn't & he got off
and i'm broke enough that i couldn't give her anything
pretty sure the lady's daughter was faking tears
but i'm an asshole and that doesn't matter
i should try to do something nice for someone
or maybe post some muppet pics
Lol I'm from NYC fuck beggars
Actual homeless and hungry to go shelters for food and a roof
Anybody hustling for money is a drug addict
They're not gonna make enough money for a hostel roof
Of course the guy next to you have $20, the daughter was told if she doesn't cry she won't get dinner
Fuck beggars
probably
yeah
i mean it seemed bs
but maybe not
whatever
It was bs
aw
what if we stopped calling them internships
and started calling them "internments"
but i can guess what i'd say
*see
on some level, doesn't making girly science shit validate what they're fighting againstb
maybe it's necessary, idk
but it would probably be a better idea to make normal science shit
and then get girls interested in that

@james
??
i have cancer
and more important than the fact that i gonna be totally fine
My post gave you cancer
Wait are you serious
is we need to decide how I'm gonna fault in our stars this
Wtf
yeah I'm serious
Are you 100% serious
yeah its just very minor skin cancer
And you're gonna be totally fine
100% serious
ill be fine
We'll that was a tiny minor whirlwind
What a kiddie roller coaster of emotions
yeah, not like an adult roller coaster
Well
no i think you got it right first time
anyway
How are you gonna exploit it for Facebook likes
for a while i can say "your post literally gave me cancer"
and i can be serious about it
I think you gotta start posting screenshots from the movie
With your face photoshopped alongside Emma Watson
when i go in for surgery or whatever, i'll take a bunch of selfies of me in hospital garb
holy shit thats great
yes
And then start posting screenshots from other movies
Nick and Nora's infinite playlist
Juno
Little miss sunshine
Put em in a fb album called The Fault In Our Ben
Wait
Idea
First status
Or
Change your profile pic to the constellation Cancer
Holy shit
Change the girl to the shirtless girl in your propic
Change the title to the Fault In Our Zweig
No bens funnier
ben is funnier
Change the girl to that topless girl tho
Change your cover photo to the constellation cancer
Post about how humor is your mechanism for dealing with it
ahaha
Hmmm
Post statuses asking for strength
IceBenChallenge
oh fuck
"where is my pixie dream girl"
"now taking applicants"
People have to either give you 100 bucks or like all your statuses from the part year
And then they tag three others to do the same
People either have to give you 100 bucks or give me 100 bucks
People either have to dump an ice cold bucket of water on their head or a bucket of boiling water
first the ice water, then the boiling water
and they can't do it the other way around
People either have to dump a bucket of ice cold water on their head or you punch them directly in the face
People either have to dump a bucket of water in their head or just cut it clean off
People either have to give you 100 bucks or you beat them up
It's a simple extortion racket
People either have to find a cure to ALS themselves or give 97$ to charity administrators
People either have to give you $100 or join the Catholic Church
People have to either give you $100 or get cancer themselves
^^^^yhats it. That's the one
a few other options
the cancer in our stars
The fault in our genomic code
The tumor in our cells
Nailed it
The lack in our empathy
The fault in our buckets
the fault in our cancer
The Galt in our John
the fault in our ben
The Bart in out Simpsons
the ben in our stars
The cancer in our young adult fiction
HAHA
GET IT
WAIT
I got it
where do i find them
They're on r/
I'm on mobile now lol
haha james, if it turns out that this isnt minor

This is the greatest thing you could do

Cyber bully till you drop
Record an album of shitty guitar music

TECHNICAL COFOUNDER
You can now officially pay to be cool
TECHNICAL COFOUNDER
I was thinking if writing more veryseriousmuai
like emoticon
oh also
had an idea
for a hACKATHON
tell me if its good
Ok
also omg
this tim draper guy looks like the hulk
like shitty hulk
Pic me
upload.wikimedia
.org/wikipedia/
commons/b/b8/
Omfg
hes shitty hulk right
anyway the hackathon idea is using BTLE
to make a playlist built on people you've passed
every day you broadcast a song
everyone you pass has that song added to their playlist for the day
and you add yours to theirs
after every day, you have a playlist from that day filled w/ songs from people you've passed
along with a note of when, where, a first name, and maybe a little pic
no major personal info
a minimal profile
and then maybe export to spotify if you want, if thats possible?
i'll need to see about that
but i thought it was an interesting idea
Hmmmmm
I like I but I don't understand it
what can i clarift
*clarify
omg he wants m e to be his technical cofounder
what a shitty fucking idea
i hate this
and then it sends spammy notifications
fuck thisss
he's making "wireframes"
and a concept design
and needs me
to make an "MVP"
buy october
and get "some traction"
your field sucks
HOLY SHIT
ben how old are you
THIS IS SUCH A BAD IDEA
it's not too late to get out of CS
"yeah in a way I would say it is, as it can help you improve areas other think are not great"
and into a real field like humor writing
"let say 50 people answer you were an ass tyne first time they met with you"
"you probably have to change something about you"
"or make an effort of smiling more and being more outgoing the first time you meet someone"
>
what a useless fucking product
it lets your 'friends' tell you you're a dick
without actually confronting you
so that you can ignore your flaws
because they're being presented
in a meaningless way
fuck cs
get out now
humor writing is a really viable field
fuck cs so much
you should honestly apply for the onion's summer internship in chicago this summer
not even a joke, i think you'd get it and i think you'd love it
send them the music blog
honestly do it
yeah ok
i think i might
"haha ben thats real funny"
ok anyway
what did you not get about the idea
i wasn't honestly paying close attention
ok no
*np
OMG this sticker set
for real though when you're not busy
let me know about the idea
Pitch it again
Les do it
ill just fucking copy paste
one sec
so next to each song, you can see when, where, and who added it
Whoa
That's a rly good song
I mean idea
Shit
No that's actually great
Id be down for that
Literally show off your cool taste to the world
that's the idea
yes
discover new music
be a fucking showoff
and just general cool factor
i think it'd be really neat
Id cast 'diamond in the back' every day
i think the idea is solid
now i need a name
Call it 'cast'
songdar
sonar
yoo
YOOOO
sonar
Sonar
I like it
its got the double meaning going on
it locates based on sound
>location
>sound
>>sonar
yeah though this would be awesome
w/ a nice UI and spotify export
it could be a real good time
for everyone involved
ok lets do it
what platform
iOS has BTLE
does android
ok
some phones probably do
Could be a we app
Webapp
can web apps use bluetooth
With geotagging
yeah i was thinking
Songs from ppl in ur area
either web app or geotag
Doesn't gotta be ppl you pass
Geotag would be p easy tbh
i think that people in your area has already happened
spotify has a "popular near you" thing
or maybe it doesn't
am i tripping rn
Idk
whatevs
geotagging could work
but it would have to run in the background, and constantly check if any other user is nearby
that sounds battery intensive
idk if its even possible
it might be
Tinder but for music recs
pls
facebook login handles name, pic, and spotify account
this is so good
what the fuck is his anatomy
big fort dag

god i can picture it now

I seriously am in
smile emoticon
we can do it at a
HACKATHON
or
just an idea here
we could just do it
and not wait for some kind of occasion or permission

the guy teaching it as an asshole
it's a sophomore class

through perserverence and strength of human spirit
I don't think so

his entire system is exactly what makes me fail
I dunno man
it's just a repeat of my last high school stint
so
change?
and I always tell myself that this time I will be able to do things differently
and the reason that this is infuriating to me is that I thought I had
but instead of reading your textbook and learning the material
when you should be watching the expendables 2
I know the material
the material isn't the problem

"Sniperville"
a small real estate development town where all the residents are special forces snipers
one guy borrows another guy's lawnmower
and doesn't give it back
so in the middle of the night he hikes 20 miles outside of the town, then spends the next 3 days dragging himself on his stomach through mud and his own piss to get in position
and fire a high caliber sniper rifle round into the guy's mailbox
they fight over things like who will run the PTA
at the local elementary school

the App
Yes
and if one person leaves to multitask/
when the other person isn't actually there, you can't send messages
only something like a poke
it also shows you where the other person is scrolled to in the conversation
so it's based on both people being totally present
it'll be pretty
That's dope
I'd never use it

i wouldn't use it either

and about nothing serious
he very much worries me
ok
in that case
forget i said anything
np
is he okay?
or, do you think he is?
i am working on finding out
i think he's a weird dude and just because he skipped all his classes and didn't leave his room for three days doesn't mean he's suicidal or depressed, it just means he's a weird dude
he is a pretty weird dude
on the other hand you don't expect texts like 'i'm batman, i can't be goofed' at like, 2:15pm with no context after not responding to fbmessages for two days
so i dunno
do me a favor and don't bring it up tho
yeah of course
thats not a thing i would do
hes basically shrek tho tbh
really?
yeah
charlie's a funny dude

You are a tremendous Big Jazz Boy.
You blast huge on the bugles and it never ends for you.
You are in love with the Jazz!
Oh, my sweet, tremendous boy, you are bursting at the seams with Trumpet Jelly.
You are filled to the brim with that Trumpet Jelly always.
Your saxophone is LOUD and it scares the animals in their cages.
When God falls asleep, you wake him up with your Big Jazz Boy bugle blasts from below.
I am so grateful to know this about you!

James

Wow$57???
because I'm 17

but this app is like, one dollar
I'm guessing the VAST majority of people who stole it could buy it
who cares tho
the DRM is hilarious
so when you first use it
and if you keep using t
it replaces your set shortcut wit
h
those options
randomly
LOL
Hey

a side of my family is from CT
I might be able to spin it
here's a $533

I like this
In two weeks when school ends ill go down the rabbit hole with u
Very
i like the change to Benjamin Zweig
Benjamin is very adult and professional
it's honestly why I added 'Adam' to my name

clickhole quiz
"Are You The Good Kid, Or The M.A.A.D City?"
this is art
what's going on
are you asking me for math help
for all values of b, if any, for which the graph of g has an inflection point on the interval  0 < x < infinity
yes
i mean i'll try it again
ok so for a point of inflection
so infinity or some shit
ok
yeah cool
that is a better way of putting it.
great but what does that mean on an intuitive level
what does an inflection point look like?
a switch in concavity in the graph of the function
i could probably draw it
sometimes at a point of inflection, the slope can be undefined. but not always, so that doesn't help me
i could just throw some points at it, but that wouldn't help me much
infinity is a big number
ok
i don't entirely know what you're talking about
here's a good way to think about an inflection point
if you have a graph, the inflection point is where it switches from being curved one way to being curved the other way
change in concavity, yeeup
like in the letter S, right in the very center, where it stops being the clockwise curve and starts being counterclockwis
yeah
so
what's wrong
so i know i should set the 2nd derivative to 0
i think i got it
ok
OH LOL
typed it wrong
does this make more sense

i have... like seven blogs
and i just got not one but two scholarships for study abroad which are predicated upon my blogging
a couple of weeks ago i consolidated my life
i want to pull the same trick for writing
the thing that made it possible was bandcamp, which let me have albums instead of a continuous stream
help me think of a way to do the same thing for blogging
like, i have a set number of music analysis posts
i don't want them randomly intermingled
but i also dont want, like, 8 urls
get it?
as you were speaking, i made myself a live soundcloud for myself
LOL
ok
what do
i do
hmm
well
are all of your blogs on the same platform
no but they could be
what r u thinkin?
adase was taken

have you ever used keezy?
Hmm
Yah
Like patatap ?
even deeper than that
so it'll be keezy
but instead of recording sound to, uh, make a sound
you'll fill each of the 8 slots by taking a picture
and then it'll analyze the picture for a whole bunch of things
dominant colors / resolution / brightness / whatever else i can think of
and turn those all into parameters for a synth

I was sober in the graveyard
and then had a weird experience in the graveyard
and then I left the graveyard
graveyard
grave
yard
it's a really big one
and while I was walking back alone
I thought about how if I tripped I might just sit there for a few hours
at least until tomorrow
with a broken leg or some shit
and right after that I tripped
oh jeez
what happened that one time you broke your leg in a bathroom
and pulled some mad fight or flight shit
and landed on my feet after kicking off of a step
it was cool
haha yeah I dislocated my knees
in a bathroom
because I had gotten taller
and my knees weren't working yet

aight so first off
"ILoveMakonnen"

POOR GUY

While in isolation in prison for 4 weeks and under house arrest for 2 years he went through periods of depression.

fuck that bad man and his bad music
Nominations: Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration
NO
He rose to prominence in 2014 after having Drake remix his song "Tuesday".
noooo
james
me & my friends were drving to in n out
at 12:30
and that fucking song
Why I love the music: Because it made me think about people, places & things I’ve never experienced. Like, in just the hook, “goin' up on a Tuesday” is a moody verse.
about the club goin up on a tuesday
came on the radio
I think the writer captured Tuesday really well.
Plus, I suggest you listen to this song on the actual day in reference. It’s just one of those songs that makes you think. U feel me? ¶
holy fuck
because we were ironically listenng 2 the radio
was it on a tuesday
fuck
nah
wow this song make me wanna get turnt at school on a tuesday
i need them
I made this song when i was getting fucked in the ass by two muscular men.
"also would it be weird if i messaged faye and was like, "you know "
fuck pasted wrong thing
plz dont
we had a fight
i was i the middle of typing a thing
here
lol
DIS DEPRESSION ASS SONG
this kane west is great actually
kane west tho
i sort of
PC music is subversive as fuk

that other good sophie song is catchy as fuck too
lemonade goes too far
its trash
but it is art trash
so
fuck music
hey QT
i hate music so much
thats why its our job
to destroy it
oh god
FUCK
i hate music journalism
let's parody music journalism
not music
veryseriousmusi
i think that's already sorta what we're doing
and even if it isnt
its only a short hop away
ok good
fuck music journalism
i hate talking about the music i like with people because they're always idiots
ok so
my problem with sartre is that i felt like he was trying to explain things that can't be explained
and my problem with pitchfork
is that they're trying to explain things that shouldnt be explained
perfect
that's perfect
fuck sartre
fuck sartre
he gets a free pass from me caring about him too much because 1) he's a philosopher
2) he's dead
those pitchfork fuckers tho
they're all alive
and they're all doing what they do to be cool and make money
t r u
very t r u
sartre only did what he did because he was an idiot loser or whatever
fuck pitchfork
"ON A FRIDAY TUESDAY BORIN"
"I can relate to this song cause I got your girlfriend in the cut and my club goin up too."
"i like drakes part BUT THATS IT!"

okokokokokokoko
trak 15
all night
thats the sleep sound
that sleep aesthetic
that sleep sound aesthetic
#
its downloading

yeah ok this yung lean vid is the #aesthetic
RIGHT
absolutely
amazing
fantastic
did it DL
or is that box
yeah
still a 'droppin
it's
so good
wow it's so good i hate how good it is
r i g ht
you probably already understood this
wow
he's
good
but do you understand even more now
how hard it is
to sit down and try to "produce" something
oh gosh
after listening to this on the reg
yeah
it's fucking difficult
oh
yeah
the guy is actually a wizard
this is like
not even an instrument
it's just sounds
yep
and noises
and feelings
he transcends instruments
and waves and lanscapes
about how i want to make music because thats how i connect with people  and learn about people and share a whole facet of myself
and how good music is my favorite vector for emotion
or maybe it was graeme, or maybe both
i cant remember
i don't think you gave that to me
ok cool
but yes
i #believe in u
jai is sorta the epitome of that for me
when i say "he transcends instruments"
i dont mean that in a BS pitchfork way
i literally mean that he bypasses his tools
i believ eit
and the end product is directly what inspired the thing in the first place
rather than filtered thru technicality
like, he is talented in just making the sound do exactly what he wants
he does a shit ton of subtle effects working together & white noise and it stops being instruments as you said
and is just sound & emotion
yeah
you can't hear the fl studio
and it's really fascinating and beautiful
you just hear the intention
and i like it a lot
yep
exactly
a good analogy is
like
how marble carvers would create fabric
yes
you dont see the stone
or the chisel
or any of that shit
michelangelo's pieta
you just see the end result, which is exactly what inspired it
which has god damn fabric wrinkles
also
susmita and i are talking about my time in sweden
and she says
"but ugh, the cold? isn't that gonna be major shrinkage?"
this is o f f i c i a l l y too much
i

'wow'

I'm in a doc martens store
I'm in a punk rock shoe store
They're playing Irish punk and people have spikes and nose rings and are paying out the ass for leather loafers
On the wall are framed black and white photos of young British teens wearing boots standing in cobblestone streets
Because there nothing more punk rock than spending a fortune on the part of your outfit that gets the dirtiest and then taking extremely and care of it
Doc martens
Fuck doc martens

trying to play anything while holding recrord on this is hard
got the same push setup tho
hey james
having a problem
Whaddup
What's going on
i'm not doing great
and i had prior plans to see a friend tonight
and we weren't in contact, so i was just lying around
and they said it was alright if i couldnt
So this sucks and is a typical high school thing that high schoolers do
Where nobody wants to seem the most involved or eager in a #cool #hangout situation
The way I personally typically deal with it is when j want to meet someone, I set a time and a place immediately
no i'm legitimately having problems getting off of the floor
this isnt about being cool or detached
Oh
Like knee stuff?
no fuck my knees
like i am having trouble finding to motivation to get off of the floor
Lol I don't know what you're talking about
Is this depression
yeah i guess so
Well I am NOT the dude to counsel you lol
haha fuck
I'm flippant and detached and haven't got a clue how to handle it
And if I were there would probably pick you up and carry you to the door.
i hoped that by saying it out loud i would realize how redic i'm being and know how to stop it
but that didn't happen
well
yeah that would probably be the thing to do
I could do that
no i think you've already done it
Ben lying in the floor is the weirdest shit you've ever messaged me about
ok
now you have done it
i mean I'm not, like
Are you sad about social anxiety? Why are you lying in he floor
lying
No I get it
i am sitting up
i was kidding
It's just like
yeah ok
i am sitting on the floor because i am depressed
i don't feel sad
i feel pretty nothing
but i don't have the motivation i need to not sit on the floor
and i am alone in the house
so there is no one there to cut right through it
and tell me to get up because i'm a big idiot
FaceTime me lol
do tha fuckin rap
Ok

i'm writing my app now
2b.) Think about a disappointment you have experienced. What was your response?
For my 17th birthday, my father purchased the S550, when I wanted the S600. I responded by destroying most of my mother's collection of porcelain cat figurines. Please do not take this into consideration as part of my application for financial aid.

"I, too, remember high school" ~ Graeme
Let it be known that New Year's Eve 2015 is the year I finally told Joseph Fridman that his debating style was little more than thinking of factoids with vaguely adjacent topics and attempting to string together a coherent argument from them #drunk
how did that
go over
Bad
I'm a mean drunk
frown emoticon
frown emoticon
I'm gooooood
frown emoticon
i got in a fight
with my dad
because i showed up 20 minutes late
to dinner
I'm too drunk to be doing this
so i left
and now i'm talking
to drunk james adam buckland
and it
is w o n d e r f  u l
Is it everything you imagined
Gnight Ben
no honestly i think we need to explore this more
maybe with some
ben zweigdj mixes
in the BG
Facebook messenger for iPad makes me believe in a god
This is some grade A on boarding technology
I can't even believe how smoothly they attempted to onboard me
that post
you just fucking liked
not even kidding
Well send me the essay then
and i honestly can't remember if it's good
i remember liking the layout tho
is it good
It's really good
Except I fundamentally disagree with the premise
haha cool
maybe i do too, now
i should read it
But that's ok. I'm a snooty classically trained pianist lol
Tools are nothing if you don't know what to do with them
I think that you were not limited by abelton or whatever. If you couldn't get the sound you wanted on a uke, tools can't help. The music is from inside.
i think that i wanted/still want to be jai paul
and will want to throw my money at anything that might help me turn into jai paul
i agree with you to a point
real instruments are limited
but i have ableton
i should be able to do anything
it
yes
that is exactly right
smile emoticon
so being good at things is hard after all
If it only took money
who knew it would turn out this way
You would be Rebecca black
that is
a fate worse than death
this is my life now

lets talk about the future of technology
a la the most recent post on my wall
always
that's always the case
is it
now
*not
the future of display technology is undoubtedly contact lens screens
siri that whispers things to you at fancy dinner parties so you can seem educated
siri that whispers things into your ear, unprompted
a keyboard that just lives on your wrists and measures tendon movement so you can type normally anywhere on any surface and it'll just guess
siri that speaks in ultrasonic pitches that only dogs can hear
siri but for sexting
>>>implying its not
siri but it'll give you sex tips during coitus
siri thats always in your ear and only makes mosquito noises
siri but on mosquitos
siri but its a tube and its always on and always listening
> > > > >> > > >
siri but a tybe
its a big cylinder that lives in your house
siri but a tube that has to be plugged in
siri but a big house cylinder
siri but just the house from Eureka
siri but with no screen, and also its a tube
the house from Eureka
LOL i actually laughed out loud
i say LOL a lot but that time i laughed audibly and almost fell out of my chair
siri but instead of showing you the information it's just a printed book with all the information already inside and all you need to do is open the book no wifi no electricity
bezos: "it's a tube right"
shows up at your door
amazon tech: "yeah duh"
bezos: "ok good"
"make sure it always has to be plugged in"
tubes are the future of technology
in the future we will all be tubes
the future of technology is the sinking cube
tube iphone shaped like a half circle. like a bent tube like macaroni. one end is the ear and one end is the mouth
tube television. you TUBE
HOLY SHIT ITS ALREADY REAL
the future of technology is the sinking cube
what the fuck does that mean
oh my god
somehow i knew before you linked me
what happened to the rest of th cube tho
thats so scary
somebody somewhere has just thousands of slivers of cubes
we don't, know

"US Census Bureau simplifies census by dividing population into only two categories, "Lloyd" and "not Lloyd""
"It was really incredible how much clearer things became when the only distinction we made between millions of people was whether not not they're named Lloyd," said one gov't official.
*or not
"I, for one, am loving the new census," said one enthusiastic citizen, Lloyd Blankfein. "I have never felt more involved in our government. I feel like my voice is being heard."

we built a glass app
let there be no doubt
you are what's wrong with this country
shaun the sheep stickers are everything
youtu.be/
LOL
an app that stabs you until you die
an app that repeatedly charges your credit card 69 cents until it gets banned
an app that sends weird sorta rude texts to your friends and the deletes them from your phone before you can see it
they're not bad enough that the friend would ever bring them up
but bad enough to make it a little weird
and you won't know why
oh my god what kind of texts
"hey"
"you know you're not that great, right"
"you're pretty ok"
"not that great tho"
or
"I think about ur cat more than u"
lost
frown emoticon
made top 10

fuck
they have it there
mhacks honeydicked me
fuck
mfw no glass
hey so
i'm not admitting weakness or fault or anything because i'm perfect
but i'm awake at 2am and i need someone to talk to and right now that's you
sure
and i have a terrible cough that scares me because i don't know how supermarkets or buying medicine works here
the only upside is that my first obligation is at 1pm tomorrow so if i have to stay up until i'm tired that's OK
but i am a little scared.
Google how medicine works in Sweden
it's probably very European
which means free, or whatever
bottom line is if you need help it's very likely you'll get it
and the connecting line is that i have not been as responsible these past three days
idk
supermarkets are weird there, they sell milk in large juice boxes
sounds like you're having a shitty start.
take the next few days to just get yourself set
i mean sort of
i love it socially and the classes are great and it's beautiful
but it all moves so fast and i forgot to eat today ???
tomorrow get blankets and food enough for a few days
yeah I feel that
you probably feel it more than I do
being an adult is terrifying
I forgot to eat a bunch when I lived alone
i will do food first thing tomorrow when it opens
blankets have to wait until my ikea trip wednesday with the organized trip and such
i'm sleeping under my winter coat
i feel very very foolish
get a coat
good
foolish > cold
yah
this is true
are you one day ahead there
it's 2am tuesday
so tell me
what happens here tomorrow
uh
mhacks calls you
they made a mistake
in the judging
you win all ten of the first ten prizes
turns out I wasn't top 10
ahaha

hey that looks nice
i suspect i'll like it quite a lot in about five days
when i get some lamps and bedding and blankets and food
but for now i'm just very mad at myself
i spent all evening studying and thinking about which classes i was going to take and mapping things out on flowcharts to check credits and emailing people about what classes counted for what credit and balancing my checkbook and generally being 'responsible'
i just feel dumb
like the ultimate embodiment of autism

remember how you googled
"angry food"
well guess what
i just had a really weird interactio
n
and im feeling really weird about it
Tell me about it
so there's this girl
>already cliche
...
Go on
and she's like
pretty attractive
and im an idiot teen
tell me more
so for a while we were jokingly talking about hooking up
but it was like
half jokingly
and then she was less joking about it
and i was like
"alright"
and then we were in a situation where that would've been something that could've happened
and when it came up she just like
became unresponsive
like, literally just wouldn't respond
so i stopped talking about it
and asked if anything was up
and why she would be unresponsive
and then she wouldn't respond to that
so i said "i feel weird about this"
and then she said "no i think we're all good"
and i said that tht isn't how i think relationships between people work
tht one person can't just say
"nope it's good"
and stick their head in the weird, unexplained behavior sand
so i left
and i think she went to bed
we're all staying in my house
~6 people
hackathon crowd
just bizarre
i came out of it feeling bad and just weird
because i dont want to pressure anyone, but she talked about it as much as i did
and then she would just clam up
and then not talk about that
so
and not talk about not talking about it
and then deny that a weird thing happened
so
that was w e i r d
she sounds messed up and you shouldn't hook up with her
that sounds like what happened
thanks
i'll do that
like a bad book you don't want to read, people who make you angry and confused and sad aren't worth your time and you rarely if ever owe them anything
yeah.
so
i shouldn't have read "the trial"
why not?
it made me sad and angry and confused
i dont think it was worth my time
and i didnt owe it anything
haha
ha ha ha
and this person
is like that
maybe not to the same degree
but yeah
thanks for reassuring me that i am not the problem
and that those around me are the problem
(not but seriously thanks)

its the little things
james i worked with my friends and made something actually kickass
can i tell you about it
its open source
and great
ya
so
its called orbit
orbit takes your local development environment and puts it in the cloud
files are editable locally with your editor of choice
but dependencies don't have to be installed locally at all
rather than waste hours setting up your environment, you can get straight to coding
so, you can do rails dev without ruby or rails installed
only sublime text & orbit
i dont know what any of these words mean
your work is kept in sync with a remote server constantly
any tool that linux can run, we can let you dev in with no dependencies
i literally dont undestand what you're talking about
you also get a publicly sharable URL where your project is running live
its not git because it provides a server where dependencies are set up, and remotely runs your code there.
we actually built our own git server for thus
*this
smile emoticon
am i still not making sense
fuck
nah im dumb
and also i am not a programmer
and don't understand depdendencies
oh so like
this still seems like github tho
github doesn't run your code
github is dumb
i mean, its a great tool
but all it does it look at files, track changes, and store them
oh
but this runs your code in the cloud?
we create an environment for your code to run, and then run it.
yes
but
isn't that like
prohibitively slow
nope!
it's perfectly fine
i thought the whole point of having a local machine is so that you can run code locally
it updates every second
you can code locally
it just runs in the cloud
oh
that seems like sharelatex
but for... everything?
you can use local editors
if a language runs on linux, we support it.
rails
node.js
python
whatever
oh
we're getting swift support working too, so you can code and run iOS apps
hmmmmm
ok
that sounds cool
if you know what it means
that's my problem with programmers is they're always just making tools for programmers
so this is cool because kiddos in high school can learn to program wayyyy more easily, in almost any language.
just how people who write musicals are always just writing about theatre
all the dependencies and setup are done on a remote server, and they can edit locally, not in shitty web tools
but
fuck web ides
so wait
how is this not a web ide
so
the dependencies are set up in a remote server
and all the files you need to code are DL'd to your machine
oh
and you can use whatever local tools you want
ok
but the dependencies you don't have to fuck with
and aren't installed
so it's like the github addon for sublime
f u c k
well i mean
sorry im dumb
it runs it too
and gives you a sharable URL that updates live
sure
smile emoticon
that's neato
sorry im dumb
hey seriously no worries
thanks for the practice
i should be able to explain this to anyone
programmer or not
u got it
and im clearly not at that point yet, haha
i already presented in front of a few hunderd
wednesday is a few thousand
jesus wow

then we'll have to say no to it because we're high schoolers lol
but it'll be a cool thing to say no to
this is dank
i m proud of u bbb
but like legit that's what fucking pisses me off about silicon valley
:)))))
we r code kiddos
airbnb is like expensive hostels for the upper class
some people make things to profit off of the stupid masses that writhe beneath them
tru
so that there's more money to pass around the silicon valley fuckboy orgy
programmers just make tools for programmers
i h8 it
it's because programmer problems are the problems programmers understand
in order to make something for anyone else
that's
fucking
dumb

so im gonna spent today in the Tivoli

Sam would
Sam would do that
i know
don't do that
i would never do that
ben are you awake
i have to talk to you about something very important
I'm almost positive
yes
so
there's a fanfic called Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
do you know about it
let me take a giant step back
a huge fucking nerd in that ass private school I went to loved it
EY is a caltech/
he runs a web forum where he discusses advanced techniques of rationality as they apply to game theory and basically STEM in general
they run a rationality wiki and a rationality subreddit where you can read about Atheism and Game Theory and uh like nothing of value
so, REDDITOR
*reddit
what the fuck, phone
no dude it's a step down from redditor
here is an example of the sort of ideology they discuss
Roko's Basilisk (you can google this if you want) is an idea prevalent in LessWrong forums
haha
this is, obviously, bullshit
but people in the LessWrong forums read it and got scared and either a) donated literally tens of thousands of dollars at great personal cost, or b) had legitimate panic attacks and were hospitalized
(brb, gotta get OJ)
bahaha
back
with OJ
in a breakfast nook of a hostel in the williamsburg of copenhagen
anyway
so this is the sort of author (EY) and crowd (lessWrong) you need to understand in order to understand HPMOR
wait, one more tidbit
haha wait
stars a Harry Potter
he wrote it?
you've read harry potter, right
yeah
here's the premise
it's the exact same universe as the real HP, no changes eXCEPT
that petunia married not one Vernon Dursely
who encourages him to be a hyperrational agent with regard to all things in his life
it's the same EXCEpT
he shoots volemkrt with a gun
the process of which fosters his 'dark side', the recessed personality of Tom Riddle, which makes him a) edgy as fuck, b) violent, c) mean and dissociative, and d) superpowerful at magic
OK SO
haha wow
all the other characters are the same, no universe changes
what a setup
except that, written by this fucking idiot, everything is different.
dumbledore, blinded by his gay love for grindlewald, is deemed an ineffective fighter with regard to voldemort
there is no quidditch
it's LITERALLY FUCKING TERRIBLE
BUT
I HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN TO THE BEST PART
because EY is a savant genius
HP takes every opportunity to pick apart the internal physical logic of every situation
here is a REAL QUOTE FROM CHAPTER 1
where HP is shocked at mcGonigall's transfiguration
"You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That’s not just an arbitrary rule, it’s implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling!”
oh my lord
benjamin zweig i have not GOTTEN to the money
this fic
is 88,000 words long
about the length of either the first four or last three HP books
thats long
it's
so bad
and i have read
all of it
i have read absolutely all of it over the past two weeks or so
this all explains
don't be like me
why this fuck i knew liked it
don't read any of it
don't read chapter one and get hooked
don't download the entire thing as an ebook onto your ipad and read it constantly from that point in
don't do it
i'm
not going to do that
good
don't
its not worth it
im not going to read anything that kid read
because of him im not going to learn about type theory or haskell, ever
and i am never ever going to read that "book"
good
instead
read Worm
it's another webfic
just as neckbeardy
but it's about neckbeard superheros who act rationally at all times
instead of harry potter characters
it's super fucking awful and you'll hate it
don't read it i take it back
don't read webfic
don't read at all
gross
im gonna hate this
dont these fucks realize that people not acting rationally is often what makes these stories at all entertaining
so i guess they just want all forms of media to exactly represent their mindset
and this is what motivates them to rewrite a classic childhood series into a 88,000 word fuckup
or maybe not
who cares

do you want an apple watch
ok, good question, lets rephrase
do i want to fucking die
actually tho
i read an industrial engineering blog
atomicdelights.
com/blog/
and now i both a) want an apple watch and b) want to be a mechse working at apple
apple makes neat shit
i'm going to read this whole article later
read the article
it speaks a lot about how a lot of the techinques for milling they use
can only be achieved with high volume
brilliant
that's pretty fucking cool
i still don't want one
y not
overpriced
1st gen
tru
limited
what about 3rd gen ~$200
*limited functionality
yes
then i will fucking buy the shit out of one
same
when apple decides to suck up the cash of the middle class again
but for now, nah
t r u
they're transitioning into a ~luxury brand~
god bless
which is almost as interesting as the manufacturing stuff, from an economics perspective
everything they do is a choiec
*choice
a brilliant perfect choice
also, the main thing that the watch does it make it less of a pain in the ass to use your phone, but apple can't say that, because it means admitting that using their phone (or any phone, but their phone specifically because they're the ones selling a new product) can be a pain in the ass
lol good point
so what we get is this weird collection of interesting ideas without a unifying message
"look at all the interesting things this watch can do!," apple says, without telling us why we would want these interesting things
it's a lot of cool ideas with nothing to tie them down yet
the product will either be killed, or the 3rd gen will be fucking great
google glass is a clumsy attempt at that
and it's pretty cool
there are already better things made, today
singularity
or whatever
nah dude
who cares
if we have contact lens screens
i want to text people using my arm as a keyboard
computers can be big again
or using my dog
as a keyboard
i want to twitch my fingers slightly in midair
while holding them at my sides
or
i want to mouth words to siri
or twitch your fingers on a dog
i want siri to be contextually aware of what i already want
i want to breathlessly whisper words to siri, as if they were a gentle kiss
and text my ex to go fuck herslf

stop me ben
349 for the shittiest apple watch
a firstgen product that is LITERALLY fucking useless without a phone
you know about that, yeah?
i know
the watch can run apps locally, but apple hasn't switched that on yet
wait
what
all it does right now is push views from an ios app to your wrist
LOL
L O L
native apps aren't real yet
349 for an additional screen
wait for gen 2/3
yes
literally that
ugh

sure, call me in 1 minute
Okok
I think you summed it up well
raw, weird anxious energy isn't logical
so I don't think there's anything logical to talk about it
so we can just talk if you want
but go talk to your dad
that's almost as good as a mom
lemme know when you're off the phone

Thank you Ben I really appreciate it. I'm going to try reading going to sleep now
ok sure
i'm sure you'll do gr8 bb
lemme know if you can't sleep
i had an idea and also did something stupid
we can talk about either
Obviously, I fell asleep immediately
Because I'm a goddamn fucking idiot
and woke up and now it's 10 and I have four hours to eat and shower and get to campus and everything worked perfectly
Ben thank you for taking my call yesterday
It helped a lot and I honestly fell asleep immediately

Let's make some dumb shit
yes please
was gonna make a medium post about what it takes to be an App Man
among the elite ranks
Oh my god
lets just make a few more stupid things, and then send it to them in a contrived way
like, take our music blog
print every page in black and white
and mail it to them

Where are their offices
Let's mail them the Kermit book
let's

they better be a good sport about this
Oh my god
Let's send them an article about their policy
to have every name on that list taken out
Holy shit
Murder the onion
that entire list is just clickhole
assassinate clickhole
for real tho
Watch the throne
lets send them a snarky article about their policy
to which they will not respond
watch
the
throne
Let's send them an article with their names and predicted deaths and causes of deaths
every name
im just gonna throw some causes of death out there ok
"wore a bread mask to the duck pond"
"talked shit, got hit"
"clown pit"
"twister"
Let's do this
Holy fuck
Google doc me now
mach 5 clownstorm
clown pit
google
doc
me
clown hut
DOC ME
i cant edit
updated
my b
hit me with that list of names
i mean
christ
what  a sad job
lets just make a list of death causes
and assign a name to each programatically
ok
we need a recurring theme
clown pit
let's
write a script
mach 5 clownblast
you load the page
poisoned clown meat
it loads the people at random from the list
yep
formats it like a clickhole article
puts in their pics
list of deaths
omfg
i'll start putting together the JSON, ok?
yes
is this going to have an API
fuck me
ok
god bless
make sure you copy the clickhole css perfectly
here's what im going to do
1 go to a clickhole page
2 copy the css
ok
6. You’ll probably start a fight if you do this one in Nicaragua, where it means “The Condescending Wonka meme I would make for you would be captioned ‘Tell me again how you aren’t a church made of excrement.’” This is the country’s national insult.
omg
ok
making json lets do this
yeah thats fine
or clickhole/html

or something

nah
is it what i'm describing
a little
i was thinking like a less malicious between two ferns, but for buzzfeed vids
JSON DERULO
JSON DERULO
what can i do to help
im writing the page
might just gut a clickhole article
do it
so
we should have
name photo cause
and then interstitial text
mhm
like how buzzfeed has gifs
and then captions like AWWww, so cute
that's right guys we all feel that way
etc
i'll write an interstitial text array
we could also do it like this
ok
i like it
or this
pick one
one of those two layouts
works bets
*best
the former
the second one is what i think you meant
i'll find images for everyone
ok cool
no need for interstitials

tells me not to tell the thiel lady (danielle)
that i left
literally are going on to bigger and better things within the time span that the fellowship application covers
i guess that helps me
O jeeez
and it's what he wants
SO
i do that
then, a few days ago
i get an email from danielle
it says
beneath that
is a forwarded message from the douchebag
that reads
1) he did this without telling me
>not interested in the engineering
like
he ACTUALLY pulled that out of his ass
That's the most dickbag move
He rattled on you
Tattled
haha wait
So? What happened
"We’re still friends"
RED FLAG
if you're still friends you don't have to say 'we're still friends'
and
finally
"we have him on as a contractor for whenever we need some assets"
that like
puts me beneath him
"we HAVE him"
"for when we need art"
so like, fjck this guy
lol here's what he looks like
I hate him already
on the left
EW
Jewish or Italian
jewish
Doesn't matter I hate his slimy hair either way
FUCK JEWS

the universal dbag face
last contact with him
Dopeeeeeeeeee
wait so
Dopeeeeeeeee
it's almost over
i have to write a response to thiel lady
explaining why i didn't tell her first
and in the process
Tell her the truth lol

It's time. We are going to build an app with which you can log in via Facebook and select one of your friends and the app will like every Single photograph that they are tagged in one every 10 seconds forever
"The nuclear option"
you'll be detected as spam by facebook's algos
let's do it
i don't know anything about making apps
with facebook APIs
or anything
wait
can you even like things
also, i don't know how to program
with their API
is there an API for liking things
wait
wait
if all else fails
I will write a script that presses right arrow
and then "L"
right arrow
l
right but
that gets shut down after about 50 likes
i've tried it
really
i'll do it right now
why
spam
i'm gonna like all your photos
sorry
plus it unlikes photos you've already liked
please don't
oh no
sorry
it's already

i thought my current one was 10/10
OH NO
OH NOOOOO
she said she loved me and I broke up with her
there's no API for love, Ben.
she cried a couple days and then wanted to have sex on the last day
actually there should be
let's write a girlfriend API
i was gonna do it but then freaked out and said I was "late to closing ceremonies"
on github
and then literally just
left
O H N O
o   h    n        o
fwiw i don't blame you
she was like
sitting there
my ex tried to pressure me into having sex before high school graduation
up until the day of graduation itself
didn't do it
w/ no clothes
in 3+ yrs retrospect
a good decision
and I said
I was l a t e
to closing
ceremonies
ben you did the r i g h t thing
and then
walked
out

anyways, now she's dating a kid who looks like a worse version of me
so no

dennis toeppen
gameplan
d e n n i s
make fake website
anonymously write mean funny facts about him
more importantly
wait how legal is this
here's his mugshot
cdn.arstechnica.
is it legal
to say
so with dennis
everything is illegal
so here's the question
if somebody owns a domain name
how can you strip control from them
how can you hack the server
this is what he owns
how legal is it
to anonymously say shit like that
James
is that legal
Lol
Who know
I'm not saying that Dennis toeppen has a hidden closet full of nazi memorabilia
nor am I saying that he wears a full SS officer uniform nightly
but what I am saying is that he seems to me like a bad guy
Omg let's Google bomb him
yep
So when you search Dennis toeppen
It directs to
social good thru SEO
like with Santorum
Nambla
yep
In testimony before the United States Senate, NAMBLA was exonerated from any criminal activities and it concluded "It is the pedophile with no organized affiliations who is the real threat to children,"[15]
"man/boy love is by definition homosexual,"
"homosexuals denying that it is 'not gay' to be attracted to adolescent boys are just as ludicrous as heterosexuals saying it's 'not heterosexual' to be attracted to adolescent girls."
>tfw Nambla is the more rational of the two viewpoints
someone just approached me at school
IRL
and said some fuckass had liked every photo they tagged me in

so
the worst thing i've ever read
is the wikipedia section on the writing and recording of foster the people's 'pumped up kicks'
On the day of recording, Foster debated between songwriting in the studio and going to the beach. He explained: "I really didn't have anything to do that day. I was standing there in the studio, and this thought came in my mind like, 'I'm going to write a song,'... and then I was like, 'I don't feel like writing. I don't want to write a song.' I was a block away from the beach, and it was a beautiful day. I kind of just wanted to just be lazy and go hang out at the beach or whatever. But I just forced myself to write a song... By that time the next day, the song was finished."
who knew it was that easy
So... it just solidified the notion that perspiration is more powerful than inspiration."[3
>the entire rest of the band does not even feature on their #1 hit song
imagine how it must feel for Jacob Fink and Mark Pontius
en.wikipedia.org
/wiki/
File:2011_MuchMu
sic_Video_Award
for a song their band did
on which their roles,
bass and drums
were filled by their fuckboi singer who decided it'd be cool to just play their tracks on logic pro
and then
when they came back into the studio from the beach
not even let them record their parts
reveal yourself and fucking fight me

i don't know how to use APIs
want to learn right now
i can answer any questions you have
it's a really really really good skill to have for fucking around on the internet
i guess
no james
it is
yeah hit me
invaluable
like, seriously
ben that's
i'm not a web dev
when you want to fuck with someone
it's not my major
ok hit me anyway
there's an API
to make it easier
1?curriculum_id=
5122e6f8b2cb8a8
what is this
let this coding app condescend to you
post requests and shit
json
restful APIs
i don't know what restful means
way to go!
i don't like this
When Web services use REST architecture, they are called RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or REST APIs. REST architecture involves reading a designated Web page that contains an XML file. The XML file describes and includes the desired content.
this feels like fake learning
it is fake learning
google "how to use apis from javascript"
and don't be condescended to
if you want
i think maybe a larger issue is
i don't know what an api is
yeah ok im not doing this
i do not have an open enough mind
to learn new skills
on the internet
frown emoticon
application program interface
no longer an ed g netkid
no james this is really fun and good
application program interface
it lets programs talk to each other
nah im done 4 tonight
so say someone has a service running
where you can send it some latitudes and longitudes
and it'll send back a lat/long pair that's an average of all of them
if that service has an API, you can build it into your app
and send it data, and get the data you want back
its just programs talking to each other on the internet
that's all it ever has been, james
i'm sorry dude
i have a shit attitude
ok well
when i don't immediately, effortlessly grasp something
it is the curse of the ctyer
my limitless curiousity is tempered only by my egotism
this is a valuable skill that will allow you to create things that would otherwise be very difficult, and beyond your normal scope
it's not that i need to know everything
it's that i already need to know everything
and facing new material that i truly don't understand is a novel and scary experience
yeah, i was a lot like that too
i probably am still exactly like that
i'm what's wrong with this generation
ugh
still tho it's 10:40pm and i don't wanna get myself worked up
because i have to skype into a wedding in an hour or so
API
use facebook's graph API
no
ben let's not

it's great and it's been great and i don't regret it
but it is not nearly the transformative cure i secretly expected it to be
yeah
ok
hm
I still would like to do something with you
because this world deserves that
looool
come visit me in europe this summer
after july 5th i have ~no plans~
I have two friends I was gonna travel with
both are 20something
one does drugs and goes to gay bars
he is the exact situation you put above
well sorta
he does have an apartment in SF
ugh
and he does want to leave it and travel
but I don't think it's to gentrify
i would not like to meet the drugs one
the other is a kid from Louisiana who learned how to program
he's funny and pretty alright
jesus

because there's literally nothing better
to reinspire academic thirst / pump up legit old school tunes / remind me of my childhood
to reinspire academic thirst / pump up legit old school tunes / remind me of my childhood

I feel like shit because of chemicals

fuck you I won't do what you tell me
humans are totally free
humans are totally free to be dicks to each other on the Internet

every other single television show
i have ever seen
GUESS WHAT JAMES
ITS ALMOST APRIL FOOLS DAY
ITS TIME TO PUT ON OUR INTERNET HIJINKS HATS
ITS GAME TIME
ITS THE BIG TOMFOOLERY GAME
AND WERE THE STAR QUARTERBACKS
ITS 4TH DOWN
AND THIS SPORTS METAPHOR IS STARTING TO BREAK DOWN
WEVE GOT TO MOVE FAST
Oh god
What do you want to do
im thinking
i am thinking so hard right now
think wtih me
we need to move FAST
Lol I'm fucking too busy today
It's 7:20
wake the fuck up its internet prank time
I have to plan clothes food books movies and music for ten days solo in Europe
So what was your idea for April fools
I think we should release a major product and then it was all a joke
a venmo bot where you send it any amount of money and it sends it back in a constant stream of 1 cent transactions
Oh my god
what should be attached to them
in the notes
Venmo would have to pay a small transaction fee for every one
Oh
The full text of atlas shrugged
random profanity
insults
Undoubtedly
oh my god
Right
Wait
Two bots on venmo
That trade back and forth
have it insert the word "ass" randomly once in every sentence
Incrementally larger values
One cent at a time
Every second
But doubling
2 cents
where do i get that money
4 cents
8 cents
From your edgy tech job
Idk
Wait
thats lame
we can do better
ayn rand was gr8
It's a venmo bot that
You send it 1c and an Ajax get request
It evaluates it
And sends back the evaluated result
Wait that's dumb
I'm dumb
You send it a number in cents and it sends back seperate transactions as the prime factorization
That's dumb
you send it any amount and it sends it back in 1 cent increments each saying the word "ass"
thats better
Asshack
asshack
Instead of masshack
lets do what we do best
and make a fake startup website
one so disgusting that it has an email form
Wiiinky
and if you enter your email
there's an alert that says
"you actually tried to sign up for this, fuck you"
Ok les dk it
What's our million dollar idea
a cloud processing service that uses slave chimpanzee labor
An app where you enter your app idea and budget and it outsources the work
Tinder but for musicians in the area to jam
^too good of an idea
Swipe left and right to sound clips of them playing
Profiles describe your soundproofing and floor space deets
holy shit
Call it
jamblr
i just thought of something entirely too dark
What
WHAT
uber for ordering sexual harassment hits on your enemies
drop a pin on their location
Uber for assassination
Done
thought of it
was too easy
could be good though
uber for getting punched in the stomach
Uber for buses
uber for being called a fat nerd
Call a bus to your location
UBER FOR BUSSES
CALL A BUS TO YOUR LOCATION
Uber for helical
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE STANDING AT A CERTAIN LOCATION
Helivac
AND THE BUS WILL COME AT REGULAR INTERVALS
SHARE YOUR RIDE WITH OTH3\ERS TO SAVE
OMG Let's do it
Uber with charter buses
james its just
a regular public bus
It'll direct you to the nearest pickup location and tell you  h waiting time
That's the joke numb nuts
but you're standing at a bus stop and waiting with your fucking phone and app out
ok good
Also
Sweden
I'm walking to class
Über for buses la do it
uber for crossing the street
crosswalk uber
uber for buses is perfect tho
Uber for buss
OMG
busber
ubus
It directs you to the nearwt pickup station
buspool
BUSPOOL
Byes
YESYESYES
we can say
that we launch today
and that buspool is availible all over th e nation
Yes
Yes
the app is already installed
the app is installed in real life

its already in real life
Ok so
im too fucking busy today to do any coding

and thats it
thats the joke

communal atmosphere
edit?usp=docslis

holy shit uber surge pricing during the 2014 sydney hostage crisis
ahahaha
thats
a website in itself
"...because this is so new, it's going to take some time for folks to accept it. there's 70 years of conditinoing around the fixed price of taxis"
literally extortion
uber stages acts of terrorism and collects a profit from people trying to escape
>
it is the literal definition of price gouging
lets write a think piece about how uber should stage acts of terrorism to drive up surge prices
uber for beings who have transcended our perception of time
back 2 the doc
class starts in 10
lets finish the copy text
you order a car, and somewhere, on same plane of existence, the car arrives

You did good
Idk how to edit
Send me GitHub login
just download allof it
download the whole page
make changes
Okok okokokokok
or
lern 2 github
and send pull requests
we did good
we have a problem with the buspool
we need to make it more obvious
that it's just a fucking bus
something about requesting it with the app, but only in certain designated areas
and while you can request it any time
the magic is, it doesn't care
it just shows up according to a schedule anyways
Ohhhhhhh
Tru
b/c that didn't make it into the final copy
people are confused as to what we're parodying
the "get buspool" button just links to google maps transit
Good point
Let's fix it
I'll b online tonight
I'll do it over break
like, my break in an hour
"here's the magic. buspool doesn't care when you request a Ride. in fact, even if you didn't request a buspool at your designated on boarding location, chances are a buspool will still show up. that's what we call service."

Tinder for musicians to evaluate each other, and meet up and jam
Swipe yes or no to audio clips of them playing an instrument
Profile info has proficiency, how soundproof your apartment is, instruments and genres
Basically a dating service for musicians to jam

could you see if you can pick them up cheaper
and ship them over
I'll reimburse for everything o/c
I'm in Vienna now... I get back to stockholm monday. Ask me again then and I'll swing by the offices myself

Would I have to mail them to you?
yeah if you can
but even if that's expensive
it'll be cheaper shipping them to me all together in one package
Honestly me shipping might be the same price as them shipping
Oh that's true
Ok I'll do it

Except Mondrian is already the name of a language and n online drawing app

Rothko is more appropriate
Nah Mondrian is sparser with white backgrounds
It's definitely a rorhko
Rothko

im sad and frustrated and a little scared
im not going to get thiel because there's a more ideal candidate on the project im working on, who started it
ᏩᎾᎾᎠ ОИЕ РГАИК
i havent found my thing yet
i might have to leave home, parents may not want me w/ them
Lol you're SO YOUNG and I know because I am also so young and haven't found my thing yet
i mean, i hope they do
but it might not be practical
I don't mean to demean you. Your thoughts and feelings are real and valid and worth acting on
But you've got literally another ten years before you need to start really knowing what you're meant to do on earth
And you're smart and employable and already making a ton of fhcking money
im just vain and crazy enough to still think i have a shot at thiel
I still think you'll get it
Is college not an option?
i got into bard, and i can probably afford it
i did not get in anywhere else
i only applied to 3 places lol
i fuckt up
Lol bard
Well there's always a gap year
ha
do u h8 bard
Take a year off, work on a dozen excellent programming projects, make some money, learn new skills, reapply next year
Plenty of people do it.
yeah ok.
And the only way for you to know short of actually going is to talk to as many people as possible and figure out if it's the place for you.
yeah
hope so
So figure out what you want to do, and take as long as you need figuring that out. Doesn't have to be one year.
and if so
I'm still figuring it out.
thats a luxury that its insane i have
I'm actually considering grad school in Europe because I'm so scared of industry lol
i dont know what i want
yeah, got into bard for cs
>>>bard for cs
.>>bard
also case
but got rejected
I have a friend at bard for cs
And she hated it
And left to work in San Fran
Ben I'm at a palace and in trying to meet this guy but I'm here for you
Will be checking fb periodically

Honestly take a day and think about what makes you happy. Not just momentary i coded this thrill but like
Long term life is worth it happy n
eveything you said has made total sense
Bb you know I'm always here for you
i was irresponsible and started this convo while almost asleep

I think you have so much potential and literally anything you choose you'll succeed at
we'll talk soon if you're around

I'm making a conscious effort to not care about this
im going to sleep but you're going to go take a long walk outside and think about what to do next
nah dude, i think that's the wrong move
but probably still feeling a little down
really?
I'm definitely more motivated for having this happen
I'm definitely more motivated for having this happen
so that's probably true
I don't want to dwell
we don't get over breakups by pretending the girl never existed
but I don't want to suppress either
we get over breakups by acknowledging that it happened and using the motivation to push us onwards in life
you will find the balance between dwelling and suppressing
for a few days, at least, think about it as much or as little as you like
and then later reevaluate yourself and decide if it is healthy
for now just go take a walk outside bbb
I will go do that now

and started pushing/
and asking why he ledt
jesus christ ben no lie tell your parents

my friend made up an excuse
and we
wait

uber driver had a charger
so my friends said "we're getting an uber, cmon"
and walked out
and I started to walk out

and asked where we were going
and said if it was cheaper she'd go with us
so I said it wasn't
and then she wanted meto bring up a map on my phone
jesus christ

don't talk to anybody ever
stay home
indoors
while i ws getting
the map up
she put her arm around me and pressed her chest into me

"Meet the Kidz"
Meat the Kidz
For a name, they wanted something generic and inoffensive, a moniker that could signify almost anything to young people but which was also different enough to be trademarked (hence the “z” in Kidz).
z = generic, inoffensive, tradesmarkable

there are people
creative professionals
who make this
for a living
and my dad is one of them
my dad works in kids TV
this show
im watchng episode 1
i cant think of anything more depressing than being the musician who made the pompidou theme song
its so bad
the dog is a puppet
this is
terrible
right
it literally gave me cancer
imagine what it must have been like to film this
oh my god
this is so bad
and it has a BUDGET
i dont UNDERSTAND
this took MONEY
this is terrible
omg
en.wikipedia.org

pompidou is
portrayed by Matt Lucas

the characters have disorders and it's a documentary
yes
oh jesus
pompidou
ben let's take shrooms and watch pompidou but listen to the it follows soundtrack
oh my god

fate worse than death
kidnapped in the middle of the night
drugged
let's do it
placed in a secure underground bunker
fed intravenously
enough air and fluid food to last 80 years
strapped to a chair
pompidou on repeat
once the first season ends
it starts again
until your brain rots
yes
human centipede but for episodes of childrens television
that's a dark thing to imagine
actually though
trapped in a room with pompidou
how long before you hurt yourself to break the cycle
the plot of it follows but with pompidou following you instead
i give it a week
pompidou follows
pompidou follows
mashup of pompidou theme song with it follows ost
holy shit
pompidou mashups

BEN let's set up mesbuck.land for me tonight
By which I mean in a half hour
"Disaster Boys – the story James Adam Buckland and Benjamin Zweig, and how they scuttled a generation"
*of
holy shit
2k in gamla stan
2096
I'm gonna die
"In any case, outclassing yourself is a good problem for Marvel to have. The biggest shame about Avengers: Age of Ultron isn’t that it’s bad — it’s not. The biggest shame is that it’s just so ordinary."
damn
Lol it's not the best film I've ever seen
But dammed if I didn't have a great time
ok cool
ABC gritty muppets
realistic edgy gritty muppets
muppets but with sex and violence
sexy violent muppets
R u online
so
for the gamla stan event
i'm building a website
we had an idea on how to avoid legal issues for the game
and that is
to make it decentralized
no central meeting place, no handing out ribbons
sign up online, get a number and secret code
that way, if you're found by lots of people, they all get very few points
if you're found by a few people, they all get many points
and if you're never found at all, you get all the points for yourself.
BUT
i need help with php / mysql
not doing it,
just setting up the templates online
i know how to write the code but i don't know how to get it set up in the first place
i bought
hideandseek.ninj
what legal issues could there be
right to assembly has a limit
honestly asking
we're at >2k
which pushes that limit
it could be seen as a protest
lol
crowdgathering activities like Improv Everywhere regularly deal with the authorities
any way to get in touch with the authorities
l o l they'd shut us down
that's why we're distributing it
massively distributed gameplay
we'll just expand the area the game covers
would they?
to a normal people density
yeah probs
hm
so
from you i need
how do i manipulate a mysql database from php
with lesser risk of sql injections
I don't know PHP
lol for real
I h a t e PHP
what kind of webdev are you
what are you even for
without PHP
use node.js :^)
the only language that matters
i don't know how and i'm not gonna learn a new package
i can do this with php watch me mom
sanitize your inputs
h o w
"What you should do, to avoid problems is quite simple: Whenever you embed a string within foreign code, you must escape it, according to the rules of that language. For example, if you embed a string in some SQL targeting MySql, you must escape the string with MySql's function for this purpose (mysqli_real_es
?
there's a mysql function for this
whoa
look up a tut on using PHP with sql
and you'll be gr8
think very carefully about how to handle the game
a number and a code is a lot to write down
thanks yeah
we're aware
but it's the only way to prevent cheating
the number is 4 digits and the code is 2 letters
give people a QR code
the number actually will be <4 digits for 75% of the
that's
a much worse idea
because phone battery
im using html inline styles and you cant stop me
my boy
smile emoticon
make sure you use negative top margin too
you're mean
were you
>implying
that I don't use negative margin a l l   t h e   t I m e
>>>>>>implying numbers can even be negatiev
>>>>>implying that's a real thing

don't be a dick

I have a question
about gasses
if you increase the temperature, the volume will increase
yeah hit me
but if you increase the volume
wouldn't the temperature decrease
even though (p1 x v1)t1 = (p2 x v2)t2
that's a good question and it demonstrates some basic chemical knowledge but it works under a few false assumptions
because there's a certain amount of energy and you're spreading it out
1) if you increase the temperature, the gas will *want* to increase in volume. it will, if allowed.
yeah, assuming constant pressure and a container of variable volume
that was an assumption on my part
OH I just got it
it was
uh ok
lol
the volume increases
i feel like i didnt really explain it yet
what's the new temperature
ASSUMING the pressure stays the same
that was the key
yeah perfect
nice, that's why
cool cool
if the pressure can change then the temp would def go down
no?
yessir
i think you got it
I was way overthinking that quiz
it's for a sophomore chem class lol
the only one they could put me in
yeah i do that a lot lol
#publicschool
#pubicschool
I don't think anyone else thought about it
in this way
last week a girl in the glass called feathers "bird hair"
is she wrong
there's one girl who asks "would it kill you if you drank it" about every chemical mentioned
would it
and one girl who was convinced that "all radiation gives you cancer. my tutor told me so"
kill me
does it
will i
won't you?
oh fucking hell
it's study hall

well i mean
if you can get us hosting
How do I sftp
so we can use sftp
Lol no
then i can provide the domain name
but otherwise
GH pages is f r e e
Ok
I'm going to bed
Can you email me the github login when you're done
I'll check it in the morning
won't need to, you'll be a contributor :^)
And start adding my shitty projects and pages and stuff
do you gave an account?
*have
I dunno
just grab jbuckland or whatever you want
I don't really understand GitHub
Or git
git is h a r d
Or how they host files for free
github is EZ
And you're not really explaining
so
it tracks changes to files
You're just sort of saying it's easy and making jokes
it's nice version control
And it's really frustrating
when there is a conflict
you can merge the changes
or decide which version overwrites which
it's how multiple people collab on software
we won't be using it as much other than a free hosting service
so it isn't all that important
but they have a free desktop app
and download those changes
and whenever you change something on your machine
Oh
That's crazy
So like Dropbox
But you control syncs
it's dropbox for code
all github is
is cloud storage for a git system
Whoa
How do they afford to make it free
it's also a sort of social network for programmers
open source sofrware
software
I
Oh
How do you know all this stuff
so it's collaborative version tracking for all sorts of programming
with a social aspect
they can make it free because of insane shit tons of venture capital, i guess
they do have paid options, but you don't really need to pay for anything
But like
That's so expensive
and if you want private repos, there is this
but it doesn't matter because there's enough free credit in what i just sent you to run some dynamic shit too if you want :^)
using other services
(digitalocean/
I literally don't know any of those words
static means no backend
What's static va dynamic
What's backend
a database
something that does logic not in the browser
Wait so static cant do php
Or MySQL
yep
That's
Useless
:^)
What's digital ocean
What's aws
and then use credit from the student pack
to handle backends
digital ocean is just servers
and you can make them do anything you want
AWS is amazon web services
they're just servers
and you can make them do anything you want
Ah
Um
Ok
What's node
node is a language for writing servers
backends
using javascript as a base
i don't think i understand what that means
oh
um
so it can do logic and stuff asynchronously or whatever
ok
yeah i misspoke
i don't know what asynchronously means
it's for writing backends
and it runs on a server
why do you need to write a backend in JS
"asynchronously
whenever it finishes, it'll do what you want with it
but it doesn't hold up other things from also happening
at the same time
um
ok
so, like
if you're loading a picture
and it's taking a while
there's no reason to wait for that picture to load
before loading everything else
isn't that a browser choice?
that was a shitty example on my part lol
if you're waiting for an API call
oh
ok
and tell you something
um
so when you call a function, you don't have to wait for it to finish before it goes to the next line
isn't JS designed for userend?: maybe. i actually dont know
but whatever it is
node makes it for servers
as long as that function is an API ?
doesn't have to be an API
when you call a function, you don't have to wait for it to finish before it goes to the next line
yes
but
lol that breaks my understanding of programming
won't other lines rely on that data?
a function returns an array full of data
well, if they do, then you wrap those functions in the callback for when the thing they're relying on finishes
how can the next line process that array if it's not full of data yet?
callback?
oh man ben i really don't know programming
lol i don't either
i couldn't make that stupid twitter bot last night
because i couldn't figure out emoji encoding in python
oh man
my friend wasn't being helpful enough so i gave up and used a cheatingly easy NPM package
what's npm
but even then i would've had to make an array of all randomized emoji
so i gave up
npm is a package manager
node package manager
but wait
what's node
callbacks
node.js ?
lets get back to those
yeah nodejs
ok
if you feel like hating yourself read this
en.wikipedia.org
/wiki/
in the meantime
i'll think of an explanation right now
gimme a sec
ok
A "callback" is any function that is called by another function which takes the first function as a parameter
A lot of the time, a "callback" is a function that is called when something happens.
no i understand callbacks
like .success for an ajax call
yes
ok
i got fucked up a lot by those when i was building the CCG website this summer
i had all sorts of things i needed to change with javascript, but only after the mysql had returned my values
so basically when you do something asynchronously (which we will call 'async" from now on)
you can wrap other code
in the callback for that asynchronus thing
*async thing
so that it will only do those things once the prerequisite operation has finished
lol ben it's 1:30 i can't
be it an API call, or processing some data, or whatever.
i can't do this
but i do understand
smile emoticon
no you can totally get this
if you can't, it's because im explaining it wrong
it's just part of program flow.
you can have little branches
lol ben i've been awake >30 hrs
it's
not
your
fault
but if you have two operations that don't depend on each other, there's no reason to have one wait for the other
and that's why we do things async
does that make sense
yes
it does
smile emoticon
but i don't think i've ever programmed anything that wasn't strictly linear
is that my fault for not thinking flexibly?
it makes things faster, sometimes
i didn't really know that was possible
if your program is simple enough then it doesnt matter
the speed gains wouldn't be worthwhile
lel
like with facebook
ben
if one part of the website loads, but another doesnt
ben it's 1:30am
i need to go to sleep
the website doesnt stop at that one part
lol k
nite
ben
do the github thing
i hope i didnt explain all of that wrong
let's
i dont actually know what im doing
i have

it's just
garbage text
ANY REVIEW YOU CLICK IS JUST

/pitchfork/
i made this a long time ago and never finished it
lets do it

HAHAHA
haaaaaa
implying
i m p l y i n g

omg
let's style VSMB like this
is that even possible
yeah
it is
just add the rest of the site in CSS
ill do that righ tnow
ok
regardless
og the CSS
that's fucking genius
you're fucking genius
smile emoticon
wink emoticon
let's start writing for VSMB again
but now it's pltchfork
PLTCHFORK
gonzo
pltchfork
jesus this is hilarious
but
let me help edit it
smile emoticon
ok now i'm going to sleep

Want to learn how to use art as a tool for activism against rape culture, sexual objectification
This summer we will be journeying into the wonderful world of culinary arts to learn about immigration history and contemporary issues, as well as the world of graffiti and spoken word as a medium to discuss fighting the sexual exploitation of women.
Lol me irl
Let's github me bb
Teach me how to hub
ok
make an account
Let me
Sober up first
ok
im here
let's do it
what should i do for my username
serious or joke
serious
jbuckland
whatever
do i already have one
lol i already have jbuckland
1 sec while i reset
you said there's a mac app?
ok
i'm @ambuc
yeah there's a Mac app
grab it
makes shit easier
i
already have it
have we done this before
ok
i did it
invite me to ur repo
home in 2
edit it locally in coda which is my preferred editor
and then upload it?
mhm
:))))
I'll show you how
whatsupinter.ne
splash page
it's gonna be shitty notemplate
you'll love it
:Do
im home
ambuck
?
ambuc
ambuc
jamesadAMBUCkla
yas
ok
i invited you to an organization
where we can add all of our shitty projects
perfect
there's a repo
whatsupinter.ne
in the organization
ok so
perfect
github installed?
ya
all good there?
got it
should open up the app
a p p
and download it to your home folder
now, using your editor of choice
ok
make index.html and save it to that repo folder
once that's done, open up the github app
and then click "sync"
in the upper right of the window
and boom
it's living in the cloud
lemme try it
if i've changed things, all you have to do is click "sync"
and it'll suck down my changes
from the c l o u d
to your machine
so click "sync" un the upper right while the repository is selected
and a file should appear in the folder
saying hey james
yep!
yeah
your index showed up on my machine
we're ready to rock and then roll
ok
nice
whatsupinter.ne
whatsupinternet.
i need to add a CNAME file and set up the domain settings
which i am doing right now :^)
ok
smile emoticon
i'll make a Real Homepage
Real Web
Real Content
lmk when you're done CNAMEing
kk
sync
im trash
im garbage programmer
CNAME added
domain settings changed
like emoticon
nice
it'll be live soon
it'll take some time yeah
let's start migrating projects
kkk
i'll make a list on the homepage
you can add projects
to the whatsupinternet
as repos
perfect
as long as you're okay with all of it being open sourced
because lets be honest
who would steal any of this
i'll add buspool
LOL
yeah of course
"The water’s fine, so why not take a dip in the POOL, the BUSPOOL."
we're fucking hilarious
LOL
it's live
whatsupinter.net
omg
it's alive
im gonna add all my own private shitty projects
you do the same
smile emoticon
we're terrible
i hate us
i can't believe i'm doing this at 1am
ben this html is too bad
you need to do this
with a t e m p l a t e
>>><>>>>
make it bad
ok
its bad
worst case
i just add a second nav bar
with my projecs
if i don't understand your code
which will be even funnier
l o l
no i'll push it
here
try that
VERYSERIOUSMUSI
i mean
lol
ugh fuck
my stupid fucking friend didn't set up the domain right
lol fight
right
nice
smile emoticon
for now it's at
and color
amazing
a m a z i ng
whats the buspool site
leave "OUR VALUES" empty
and just start the next section
LOL
yes
let's host that locally 2
make sure there's a space too
so they know it's intentionally empty
I'm going to make another shitty website today
about baseball
ok
im done with the homepage
PLZ edit it
i'm gonna transfer my shit projects now
okkkkk
*kkkkk
kkk
so wait
i should add my stuff as repos?
how will it get hosted
yeah so
can i just add new pages on the current repo
or
that
lol u do it first
im not literate
im 2 dum
do
so
i added a repo
wiinky
now what
username.github
username.github
orgname.github.
also we can do a custom 404
oh boy
oh god
ben i dont know what any of that means
frown emoticon
done
whatsupinternet.
github.io/
or
whatsupinter.net
replace whatever it added with your own site
when you go to /wiinky
so replace what's in there with whatever you want
wait
where?
so i guess take everything in the master branch
whats a branch
wha tthe fuck
ok i did it
i did it all, buster
yep
done
whatsupinter.net
now shows wiinky
you got it
yay
ok
so just this
forever
right so
is there a hosting limit?
i was looking through that right now
and also nope
free unlimited
so you can do it through terminal
ooor
click repository settings
scroll down
and click "generate site"
click continue continue
it'll make the branch
and then you delete everything it made from that branch and add everything from master
it's a workaround
ok i guess ill do one right now and you'll walk me thru it
but it avoids doing terminal shit
unless you want to do that
i would rather do terminal
yeah so i'll do bushel right now
than this weird interface
oh ok
lol
ok
buspool ?
nah i;ll stick with the interface
also ben im a little fucking drunk
so
it's a miracle i can even type
lol fuck all that
ill do interface
im too drunk to muck about with terminal
ok
lol
the other way
is just to add folders to the main website repository
ok
but
nah this is more fun
if we do that
it makes it harder to add projects that are actually code
IM GOOD
whatsupinter.net
rather than just a putrid fucking website
WHOA
i know how 2 git
the hub
same :^)
whatsupinter.net
lol use my shitlord
i already have
wow
this is
working
i have more but they're not as terrible
just
projects
is that fair game
ben i want you to redo the homepage
and make it look Startup
just use what we made for Big Fart Dog
and we can put projects in those squares
that was a great template
and i like the muppets stuff
im gonna keep adding repos
under "portfolio"
we can remove the stupid jokes
and add projects
if you w a n t
exactly
yes please
can you do that?
trash my garbage index.html
yeah easily
im ashamed of it
but
lol 'easily'
oh god
bigfartdog is funny as hell
to us
whatsupinter.ne
what do you think
yes
i agree
ok
good
sorta strange
but do the homepage template plz
big fart dog is funny as hell but not a joke that can be explained
yeah
so new website
ok
more repos
whatsupinter.ne
same template
replace all instances of bfd with whatsupinternet
done
but
let's use this image
somewhere
oh man i forgot about @startups
julian and i started this and then he ditched
oh my god
that image
send me the source
ok
im a shitgrammer
i made a cool functionality
imma repo it
you can take a look and help me format it better
here
whatsupinter.net
i need a Cool Template and your advice
this is great
we can make shitty turd projects
and help each other
but im not that good at anything unless i have someone else to bounce off of
smile emoticon
but yeah
whatsupinter.net
just cool language pattern stuff
l o l
i really like the name generation service
let's
do something with that
AN API
teach me how to MAKE an API
like
make an API that other people can use?
lol
i guess
this is great
i need to go to sleep because its 2am
this is ridiculously good
sorry been mad distracted
by d e p r e s s e d d a d
lol oh no
and s a d a u n t
new aesthetic
relatives with feelings
ecstatic cousin
realizing your parents are people too and that they're not necessarily good role models just because they gave birth to you
>>
the end
gnight ben
the stage is set
good Big Farting, Dog
for our deplorable shenanigans
to unfold across the web
my garbage boys
2012
actually edgy
what the fuck was i thinking
oh man
im 2 bad @ this
whatsupinter.net
what else have we made
what's next
what do i ~programm
i think i didnt make whatsup edgy or netkid enuf yet
im
pretty happy with the current whatsupinternet
you're awake
i've been working on the page
too much
it looks good now
i fucked up
fuck
link me
...
whatsupinter.ne
whatsupinter.net
oh my god
it's too good
and it's only going to get better
your turn
go to town
i know how 2 git now
smile emoticon
i rolled back a change a few hours ago
i'm a pro
you're a pro.
I'll SYNC
let's make a new thing
a graveyard for failed technology
but instead of filling it with Actually Failed Tech
we fill it with the names of people we know
can you think of anything else we've built
i have vague early memories of other stuff
other Big Farts from the Dog
faint, echoing farts
hmm
Buttons
Shirts
Meatspace projects
shirts
Real life farts
netfarts
Internet hijinks
oh man we gotta put a playlist up on there
internet hijink music
for sure
the other part of this is now we have no reason
not to do hijinks
tru
ok I'll work on site
you need to use that image you sent
on the site
also use the bad.mean.good camcorder font
I have all the .ttfs
I'll add to repo
you can sync them down
I did it
whatsupinter.net
click it
check the aesthetic
Do it all
Let's do dumb shot
I'm entering
a tame impala phase
An app for filming police brutality
Uploads live during recording
So you can't delete it
brutal.ly
Social network with the ability to identify cops and
RLY
no lol
make it and use that
Lol I should

Hey Ben I'm at a shit party and I hate it
If I go home
Will you program something awful with me
yes
absolutely
I'm out of class in an hour
frown emoticon
Ok perf
I'll be home by then
I m redy
heading home
Lol it's so late here
what can i be doing
what is there left tod o
ideas
Google doc
do we have one?
or fuck w/ website
do you SEE that don't
*font
Lol i love it
home
let's do this shit
YES
what are we doing
getting laptop
one dev
sec
git me in the hub
editor?
yeah
it's like a sublime text that works
lol
>Atom can't open files above 2MB
seriously
should i b using Brackets
i use sublime and i've never had a problem
or Light Table
l o l
lol fuck brackets
sublime is C++ and can open any size like a CHAMP
light table is cool but not really awesome
like
it's not practical
at least it wasn't when i tried it
sublime has never crashed on me
and works perfectly
lol my sublime crashes a  lot
i have 2 many extentions
i should get ST3 tho
I'm running 2
3 is probably fine?
who cares
ok let's code
what's next
we're not real hackers
real hackers use VIM
>>>vim
i use vim lol
you're
a
real
hacker
vim is ok
my real summer job had lots of sshing into servers and changing lines of php with HIGH RISK and no possibility to sftp clone
so
so
what are we making
so
ok
google doc
ideas
ill make it
hit me
i'll listen to Out Of Touch to get myself inspired
which one

whitedevilsophis
is

UGH
The Memesmiths
fuck you don't desecrate the only good band left
>
>implying i'm wrong
>you're not wrong
let's make a website
FUCK why is having idaes so hard
i have an iphone list of ideas
so here's the idea
when you go to someone's house
instead of asking for their Network and Password
you take a picture of a QR code hanging on their wall
here's the trick
we don't try and market this as a shitty app
HERE'S THE TRICK
ITS A LINK TO PORN
you got it
THEY JUST OPENED A LLINK TO PORN
ok here's the idea
IN A FRIEND'S HOUSE
it's a layer of annotations for the web
but like
triggers
so if something triggers you
you can tag it
wait
we talked about this
it's a g00d idea
and i had a great idea
about it
do you remember
do
you
remember
but they can choose to add a <meta> tag
my idea
<meta>
what was your idea
do it anon or under a fake identity
market it for 2 weeks
without actually releasing the extension
release it
it blocks every single fucking page as having a trigger warning
uh oh
no matter what
and then that's the end of it, or
nah i mean let's really build it
it asks for 5 dollars
either
"build it"
let's really write up a spec sheet for the <meta trigger> tag
doesn't that, like
validate a bunch of weenies
there are legitimate triggers
but you don't need a meta tag for that
like humans.txt
which would be hard to adopt
just a local plguin
that looks for keywords
ok then a local plugin
and if it finds them, blocks the page
like if it says "rape" anywhere
it gives you a warning
that searches terms and terms which often occur in proximity
thta's
and a proceed with caution button
a really good idea
yeah
"LOOK THERE'S THIS ONE WORD HERE THAT WOULD UPSET YOU"
l o l
"BUT DEF DON'T LOOK AT THE CONTEXT"
but that's what they want
ok
if you actually want to help people
other ideas
make something that blocks the whole page
lol i dont wanna help anybody
if you want to do a funny stupid thing that makes fun of people
do the word
that's why i'm an engineer working in green energy technology
lol
whitedevilsophi
let's make a program that
fuck idk
i h8 programming
let that
inspire you
fuck
that's cruel
y e s
open terminal
do
still great use of .sh
just
lol i will not be doing that
it picks one of 6 things randomly
no seriously
you do it and screenshot it 4 me
look at them
some of them are fucking brilliant
james
if you leave off the | bash
l o l no
it literally cannot hurt you
it puts it nowhere
it just displays it in the window
send me another $1000 amazon card and we'll talk
do u even bash
u do it and screenshot it
because
lol u say i'm dumb if i don't do it
but if i do it and it's the wrong thing to do
u'll just say i'm dumb for not knowing
lol i'll do it
it's just long

agar.io/
this is really cool
i lost hours on that yesterday
so good
ok
i stopped
ben hold the phone
bootstrap is over
materializecss.c
I'm a big fan of this terrible layout
Terribad
Lol yeah
an app that converts you into a polyphasic sleep schedule
an app that analyzes your facebook history and when you get likes and when the statuses get likes and you post to it and it decides what time of day to post it for the most likes
an app that weighs you. you stand on the phone and it weighs you
an app that tells you whether or not you deserve good things in life
an app where you enter your app idae and it tells you whether it's been done already or not
i thought of an Actually Useful App
it's just a skin for Wiktionary that makes it easier to use as reference
you select a Language and you enter a Word and it grabs it from Wiktionary and presents you with the conjugation and stuff all in a nice Aesthetic way with no extra clicking, as fast as you can type it
fuck i'm putting this in the Bullshit Ideas app
let's build this
this'll be good, i can learn how 2 use an API and we can use the materialize css templates
sweet
i think this is Legitimately a Good Idea
wiktionary has so much useful stuff but it deserves better layout and faster access
mhm mhm
a Cool Edgy web 3.0 responsive layout
i can d e s i g n it
can we use node.js for this
can i learn node.js AND apis at the s a m e t i m e
i'll probably just need an XML parser tbh
and then i can push the stuff as json
and we can plug it in using a n g u l a r . j s
>i fucking love angular.js
let's use as many packages as possible
let's also use LESS so i can learn what LESS is

In security engineering, security through obscurity is the use of secrecy of the design or implementation to provide security. A system relying on security through obscurity may have theoretical or actual security vulnerabilities

zuck
(1) is it unnecessary and fills no particular function
(2) does it work consistently across all platforms
(3) does it lessen the quality of discourse
(4) has it been around for a long time on other platforms
(5) was it rolled out only to some people with no warning
(6) is there no way to revert

I took my meds
and now I'm a n g r y
emojihad
Let's program that
What was going wrong?
emojihad
I couldn't encode emoji in Python lol
also Python was h a R d
so I was going to use an NPM plugin
U just gotta find a pre encoded list somewhere
not plugin
npm package
that was a simple Twitter bot
can I call you in a few min
L o l I'm in Sweden
FaceTime? Facebook?
I can try to type
Nah call me
It's cool
yeah facetime's good
FaceTime a u d i o
calling
is it not going thru
Lol hold on a minute
I'm about to do a laundry pass
Wait Ben
A gun to the head of every emoji
Or every living emoji
every
fucking
emoji
Ok
Deal
they all die
we're indiscriminatel
"we're indiscriminatel
I CANT DO THIS
UGH
That took fucking for ever
I'm an idiot
you're incredible
also, I have an even more hilariously fucked up idea
that I developed with Graeme yesterday
This account has been terminated
Hit me
What's ur idea
wait, should we have different ways of killing them
like
No
Oh no
or only gun
I did it Ben I'm a racist
many or just gun
Just gun
ok
Repetition is always funny
ok so
the idea is a fleet of Twitter bots
that act as a sponge for negative online attention
by actively injecting themselves into what it perceives as shitty conversations w/ bullying or death threats or whatever
it could either be srs
and a way to try to take attention away from real people
and have them bully robots instead
or make it surreal as fuck
like a Twitter bot where wherever it sees a rape threat
it jumps in and says "rape me instead"
>>>
oh my god
wait can you talk now? im upstairs and on wifi and can talk
yeah sure
I mean I'm in an open class
where people are talking
figured it out
the first step is to build Emoji as a Service
ping the API and recieve a random API
i mean, ping the api and recieve a random emoji
then we can use that in the larger bot
OR service as a service
ping the api and get a random bit of data from a random api
fuck this wifi
l o l
but yeah this sounds good
two projects
emoji bracket
whats the name for a bracket
tourney
WAIT
EMOJI MADNESS
emojihad is just the brown terrorst emoji bombing every emoji
>>>>>
three projects
easy
>I considered it
How. Many weapon emoji are there
Wrench is no good because no direction
Pill is no good either
both die
yeah perfect
50/50
Omfg
Let's do this
📌✒️
Ok nice
But no box emoji
?
🏇
run down to death
on a horse
Lol yes
yeah no boxes
>>>
ok final list
here
🔜
Omg
ok
we need
to add some certainties
to the bracket
I can't do black man on iPhone
not on 8.3
but like
white cop has to shoot a black man
and terrorist has to plane or bomb some people
and we make it seem random
like the rest
but it's n o t
omg so
the terrorist, black man, and cop have to rise thru the bracket defeating everybody they encounter
and the finale of the bot is truly random between the three of them
ahaha
they don't have to
it can just be a couple times
how is my phone so bad
got up at 7:30
100%
it's 10:45

@emojimadness
yes please
wait here's the idea
it's an app you turn on when you're on a plane
America's Next Top Motherfucker
it finds out when your flight departs and lands and how much you spent on it
and the dollar bills fly offscreen as you fly through the air
I need a Twitter bio as good as graeme's
that's what I need
Link me

On a Friday night, you can find me on Zuckerberg’s Famous Distraction looking at photos that I am not in and saying, “Surely, Zuckerberg is mad if he expects me to view each and every one of the billions of photos that he has put on his Famous Distraction, but I intend to do just that.”
One night, I looked at so many photos on Zuckerberg’s Famous Distraction that Zuckerberg himself called me up and said, “You’re doing it right. You’re supposed to see them all.”
Yes, I have seen all the photos on Zuckerberg’s Famous Distraction, and yes, I have personally asked Zuckerberg for more to look at instead of doing work, and he has generously provided more.
what are you doing this weekend

I think I'll pirate guardians of the galaxy just so I can have it on my laptop

we can only go further down from here

Stupid Shit That No One Needs and Terrible Ideas Hackathon
can a green owl really depict how you feel
yeah I think so
oh my god
wait
oh my god
and making new stickers in the same art style
political interpretations
NO
and using them to represent
requires 2 much talent
really fucking awful emotions
like
a green owl sticker for racism
sunny eggy
for when you have a miscarriage
An app that lets you log when and where you poop
And geotags it
I just downloaded a bible app because it looked pretty
wow
this is actually pretty nice
I've never read the bible
and I'm not about to
but this is pretty
im not religious but i legitimately enjoy the bible
read Ecclesiasties
ok
it's full of excellent irreligious parables about morality and fables
i did bible study at synagogue and took an old test. class in high school
im not super knowledgeable but i do know my old testmament
ecclesiastes is GREAT fuck i forgot how good i t was
ok I'll read it
poo time
seek jesus
wëïrd
BFD is futile
and a pursuit of the w I n d
the FART wind
Not now bb I'm about to head out
Are you ok?
yeah I'm fine
tinder CLI
I'll msg you from the train
Ok not worth finding wifi for lol
it's 1 AM
I didn't go to prom
I am outside
renegade teen life
Ok app idea
Gonna be ridiculously easy
Let's teach me how to app
TV show tracker that just sort of watches where you are in a season vs what's aired (which you can find online)
You go thru and subscribe to shows
Dead simple swipe to mark off an episode you've seen
As they air, they accumulate onscreen and it helps you keep track of how far behind you are in different shows
Use IMDB with air date info as an API and make it gesture based
An app for thin people and fat people to find each other and sit together on airplanes
A startup parody page for Paper Rectangle Money and Metal Circle Money
A startup parody page for a good replacement service but it's just Food
Buy ingredients at any store and prepare it yourself at home for a fraction of the cost
No delivery fees!
App idea: you enter your app idea and it tells you it's shit
App idea: a robot you text like a girlfriend but it ignores you
App idea: duolinguo for owl hoots
App idea: Facebook sticker occultism
Ok real idea
Fake movie critics
Generate universally positive reviews of movies cobbled together from generated sentences
Universally in vague praise
As tho an old man were being paid to say nice things
I know the exact tone you mean
Let's do it
How hard could it be
im sure there's a way
ok so movie review tone
wait some of your above ideas
never reference the name of the film
were actually really funny
LOL which
duolingo for owl hoots would've won
when you're asleep i just post random shit to this convo
duolinguo for owl hoots
omfg let's du it
App idea: a robot you text like a girlfriend but it ignores you
also would've won
either
omfg
an app to place thin and fat people next to each other on airplanes
wizardry.bizbizb
but instead of magic
a girlfriend
what is bizbizbiz.biz
some dude's website
he made a magic parody too
just like us
thats fucking great
let's be rivals of industry
and let's also make THE GREATEST APP IDEA
VOTING APPS FOR US ELECTIONS
revolutionize politics by letting anyone vote on anything
if your local representative is voting on a bill today, send him a PM nudging his vote in the direction you want it
we could make faux mockups with profiles and interfaces and really fucking sell it
yes/no
yeah that actually sounds cool
the trick will be the best Name
and then we write lots of snarky inspiring copy and people fall for it
Votr
or automate it lol
im going to dinner and when i get back we can flesh this out

Twitter bot to trawl our conversation feed from the past five years and randomly post things out of context
Y EP

And we have to OK each thing first in case it's 'delicate'
Like with an approval queue

But then we'd have to download a new one all the time and run the extractor on it
I want it LIVE
